We’ve been working on making it even easier to customize your site. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drafting (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\">#39896</a>) and scheduling (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\">#28721</a>) of changes in the Customizer. Once you save or schedule a changeset, when any user comes into the Customizer the pending changes will be autoloaded. A button is provided to discard changes to restore the Customizer to the last published state. (This is a new “linear” mode for changesets, as opposed to “branching” mode which can be enabled by filter so that every time  user opens the Customizer a new blank changeset will be started.)</li>\n<li>Addition of a frontend preview link to the Customizer to allow changes to be browsed on the frontend, even without a user being logged in (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\">#39896</a>).</li>\n<li>Addition of autosave revisions in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39275\">#39275</a>).</li>\n<li>A brand new theme browsing experience in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37661\">#37661</a>).</li>\n<li>Gallery widget (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41914\">#41914</a>), following the media and image widgets introduced in 4.8.</li>\n<li>Support for shortcodes in Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10457\">#10457</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for adding media to Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40854\">#40854</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for adding oEmbeds outside post content, including Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34115\">#34115</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for videos from providers other than YouTube and Vimeo in the Video widget (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42039\">#42039</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve the flow for creating new menus in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40104\">#40104</a>).</li>\n<li>Educated guess mapping of nav menus and widgets when switching themes (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39692\">#39692</a>).</li>\n<li>Plugins: Introduce singular capabilities for activating and deactivating individual plugins (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38652\">#38652</a>).</li>\n<li>Sandbox PHP file edits in both plugins and themes, without auto-deactivation when an error occurs; a PHP edit that introduces a fatal error is rolled back with an opportunity then for the user to fix the error and attempt to re-save. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21622\">#21622</a>).</li>\n<li>Addition of dirty state for widgets on the admin screen, indicating when a widget has been successfully saved and showing an “Are you sure?” dialog when attempting to leave without saving changes.

Integration includes support for linters to catch errors before you attempt to save. Includes new APIs for plugins to instantiate editors. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423\">#12423</a>)</li>\n<li>Introduction of an extensible code editor control for adding instances of CodeMirror to the Customizer. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41897\">#41897</a>)</li>\n<li>Addition of global notifications area (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35210\">#35210</a>), panel and section notifications (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38794\">#38794</a>), and a notification overlay that takes over the entire screen in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37727\">#37727</a>).</li>\n<li>A date/time control in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42022\">#42022</a>).</li>\n<li>Improve usability of Customize JS API (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42083\">#42083</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37964\">#37964</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36167\">#36167</a>).</li>\n<li>Introduction of control templates for base controls (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30738\">#30738</a>).</li>\n<li>Use WP_Term_Query when transforming tax queries (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37038\">#37038</a>).</li>\n<li>Database: Add support for MySQL servers connecting to IPv6 hosts (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41722\">#41722</a>).</li>\n<li>Emoji: Bring Twemoji compatibility to PHP (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35293\">#35293</a>). Test for any weirdness with emoji in RSS feeds or emails.</li>\n<li>I18N: Introduce the Plural_Forms class (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41562\">#41562</a>).</li>\n<li>Media: Upgrade MediaElement.js to 4.2.5-74e01a40 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39686\">#39686</a>).</li>\n<li>Media: Use max-width for default captions (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33981\">#33981</a>).

Still, the WordPress Core team is exploring a move <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\">to make WordPress framework-agnostic</a>, so that the framework being used could be replaced by any other framework without affecting the rest of the project.</p>\n<p>This is a bold move that will ultimately make WordPress core a lot more flexible, and will also protect it from potential license changes in the future.</p>\n<p>You can get involved in the JavaScript discussion by joining the #core-js channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>Community Initiative to Make WordCamps More Accessible</h2>\n<p>A WordPress community member, Ines van Essen, started a new nonprofit initiative to offer financial assistance to community members to attend WordCamps. <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC</a> launched with a crowdsourced funding campaign to cover the costs of getting things up and running.</p>\n<p>Now that she’s raised the initial funds, Ines plans to set up a nonprofit organization and use donations from sponsors to help people all over the world attend and speak at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>If you would like to support the initiative, you can do so by <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/make-a-donation/\">donating through their website</a>.</p>\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator Program Returns</h2>\n<p>Following the success of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/\">the first WordCamp Incubator Program</a>, the Community Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/09/27/wordcamp-incubator-program-v2-new-role-name/\">bringing the program back</a> to assist more underserved cities in kick-starting their WordPress communities.</p>\n<p>The program’s first phase aims to find community members who will volunteer to mentor, assist, and work alongside local leaders in the incubator communities — this is a time-intensive volunteer role that would need to be filled by experienced WordCamp organizers.</p>\n<p>If you would like to be a part of this valuable initiative, join the #community-team channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Community Team blog</a> for

released to the world</a> — this was a security release that fixed nine issues in WordPress Core, making the platform more stable and secure for everyone.</p>\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team

the WordPress platform and ecosystem, a structure that powers, today, over 28% of all existing websites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The localisation process allows for WordPress and for all WordPress-related products (themes and plugins) to be available in local languages, so to improve their accessibility and usage and to allow as many people as possible to take advantage of the free platform and services available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a (not completely) serendipitous coincidence, September 30 has also been declared by the United Nations “International Translation Day”, to pay homage to the great services of translators everywhere, one that allows communication and exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The event will feature a series of multi-language live speeches (training sessions, tutorials, case histories, etc.) that will be screen-casted in streaming, starting from Australia and the Far East and ending in the Western parts of the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that same 24-hour time frame, Polyglots worldwide will gather physically in local events, for dedicated training and translations sprints (and for some fun and socializing as well), while those unable to physically join their teams will do so remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A big, fun, useful and enlightening party and a lovely mix of growing, giving, learning and teaching, to empower, and cultivate, and shine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some stats about the first two events:</span></p>\n<p><b>Global WordPress Translation Day 1</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">448 translators

A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/\">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy\">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/\">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/\">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">for testing</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/\">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/\">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/\">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/\">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/\">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href=\"https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac\">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/\">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">submit it here</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></i></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4899\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WordPress 4.8.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/wordpress-4-8-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 21:26:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4875\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:366:\"After over 13 million downloads of WordPress 4.8, we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of WordPress 4.8.1, a maintenance release.

Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/\">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/\">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule\">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/\">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycle’s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/\">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/\"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/\">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/\">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/\">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/\">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/\">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/\">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/\">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/\">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/\">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/\">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bridget Willard <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/\">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href=\"https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/\">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/\">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress\">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href=\"https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/\">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4865\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"WordPress 4.8 “Evans”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:49:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:373:\"An Update with You in Mind Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1-video\" width=\"632\" height=\"342\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"Link Boundaries\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world?

These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/\">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

A snapshot of its database from 2012 with information dating back to 2007 containing email addresses, usernames, sign-up dates, and last login dates in plain-text were exposed.</p>\n<p>Passwords hashed with the SHA1 protocol and a salt for about one-third of affected users are also included in the snap-shot. Disqus was made aware of the breach and received the exposed data on October 5th by <a href=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/\">Troy Hunt</a>, an independent security researcher. Today, the service contacted affected users, reset their passwords, and publicly disclosed the incident.</p>\n<p>Jason Yan, CTO of Disqus, says the company has no evidence that unauthorized logins are occurring due to compromised credentials. &#8220;No plain-text passwords were exposed, but it is possible for this data to be decrypted (even if unlikely),&#8221; Yan said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a security precaution, we have reset the passwords for all affected users. We recommend that all users change passwords on other services if they are shared. At this time, we do not believe that this data is widely distributed or readily available. We can also confirm that the most recent data that was exposed is from July, 2012.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since emails were stored in plain-text, it&#8217;s possible affected users may receive unwanted email.

Public testing went well enough that a commercial tier of the service is now available at <a href=\"https://wpsandbox.io/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WPSandbox.io</a>, with plans ranging from $49/month &#8211; $699/month, depending on the number of installs required.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On any given day we have around 3-4K active installs,&#8221; WP All Import team lead Joe Guilmette said. &#8220;We actually got around 7K the first day and the infrastructure didn’t go down. So we were pretty stoked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guilmette said a few plugin and theme shops are using the service and one developer even wrote a script to iframe their poopy.life installs for use in their theme demos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ll probably put a stop to that at some point, but it was pretty cool to see,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;Tons of people use it for testing plugins, themes, and just all sorts of general WordPress testing. We’ve been using this internally for years, and every time we&#8217;d fire up localhost or a testing install, it’s just faster to use poopy.life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pro users get all the convenience of Poopy.life under the more business-friendly wpsandbox.pro domain with a dashboard to manage installs, SSH and SFTP access to their installs, and the ability to hot-swap between PHP versions. Having Poopy.life open to the public has given the team an opportunity to address any remaining pain points with hosting thousands of test installs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since launching poopy.life everything has actually been pretty smooth,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve already been using various versions of this internally to sell millions of dollars worth of plugins over the last five years. So it’s already been hacked to pieces, DDoSed, etc. We’ve already been through all that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the team first started Poopy.life as an internal project for WP All Import, they had a difficult time trying to host it on a VPS with the requirement of isolating installs from each other without any professional systems administrators on board.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were getting hacked all the time, so we started using CloudLinux, the same software that a lot webhosts use for their shared hosting servers,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;This also prevents resource hogging, where someone could start mining bitcoin and then everyone’s installs would take forever to load.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then came the spammers, using their installs to send out email spam. So we learned we had to discard e-mail silently while allowing scripts that expect e-mail to be available to still function correctly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we went on that whole journey, it was kind of a no-brainer to share this tool with everyone else. We’ve been through a lot of pain in building this platform, and in opening this up to the public we hope we can help others avoid those same issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team now has two systems administrators on call 24/7 to get the service back up and running quickly if anything breaks.</p>\n<h3>WP Sandbox Service is Aimed at Theme and Plugin Developers</h3>\n<p>In the past six months since opening Poopy.life to the public, Guilmette&#8217;s team has learned several valuable lessons in how to market the commercial service.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We use the Sandbox for so many different things, so the in the beginning the temptation was to kind of market it to everyone who we thought would find it useful,&#8221; Guilmette he said. &#8220;We didn’t find a whole lot of success, and are now focusing on plugin and theme developers. It’s helped us so much for WP All Import and Oxygen &#8211; everything from increasing sales to making tech support much easier by giving users isolated places they can reproduce problems. We know plugin and theme developers need this tool, so it makes the most sense for us to focus our marketing directly at them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Having a way to allow users to try a product like Oxygen before purchasing will be particularly useful in the Gutenberg era, where many users are unsure about the differences between what core will offer and what a site building product can bring to the table. Guilmette and his team are optimistic about what Gutenberg will bring to the customization experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We can’t wait for it to ship in core,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;I think a lot of the negativity about Gutenberg is from folks who make page builders and view it as competition. But Oxygen is a site builder, not a page builder (i.e. you design headers, footers, etc.). We don’t see Oxygen as competition; we think it will enhance the Oxygen experience. We think Gutenberg is great, and are excited to see some other talented teams out there working hard to make WordPress easier to use for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said his team is hoping to provide a Gutenberg component that users can drop into Oxygen and then edit that area of the site with Gutenberg. Having a sandboxed version of this available for users to test will help them to understand how the product works before purchasing.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether or not WP Sandbox takes off with other WordPress product companies, WP All Import and Oxygen have benefited from bringing sandboxing to the sales experience and continue to make use of the architecture the team has developed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We generally avoid big, coordinated releases,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;We prefer to slowly build a product around a group of slowly growing users. If you release a finished product to the world, chances are you spent too much money making something no one wants.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It hasn’t paid for itself yet, but that’s to be expected. We have enough users to make us optimistic, and some very exciting customers in the onboarding process. Once we get a few big names using it and other plugin developers realize the benefits of using it, we think it will take off.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:17:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: WooConf 2017 Livestream Tickets Now on Sale\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75369\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/wooconf-2017-livestream-tickets-now-on-sale\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2445:\"<p>The third edition of <a href=\"https://wooconf.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WooConf</a> is being held in Seattle, Washington, October 19-20.

One of the most visible updates for those who are testing the Cover Image block is the addition of an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2815\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opacity slider</a>. It brings more flexibility to the feature than the previous on/off background dimming toggle provided. Users can now slide the opacity along a range snapped to percentages of 10.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cover-image-block-opacity.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 1.3 also introduces an option to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2807\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">convert a single block to an HTML block when Gutenberg detects conflicting content</a>. This is a precursor to an open issue that proposes <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2794\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an HTML mode for blocks</a>, essentially a mechanism for each block to be edited as HTML. Contributors are still discussing the best approach for implementing the UI, which we will likely see in a future release.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-1.47.01-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg 1.3 adds a new submenu item that ramps up the potential for gathering more feedback from people who are using the plugin. The Feedback link appears in the plugin&#8217;s sidebar menu and leads to a polldaddy form that separates users&#8217; comments into either either a feedback or support channel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-05-at-2.03.23-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Instead of relying on testers to know where to go to offer feedback, the new link offers them an easily accessible avenue for sharing their thoughts and concerns. This option is especially helpful for those who are not as adept at using GitHub or writing meaningful bug reports. The forms guide the user to report important details of their setup, browser information, screenshots, and other useful information.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg does not track any information about users who submit feedback via the Polldaddy forms and there is nothing to indicate that the responses will be made public. It is unrealistic to expect that the Gutenberg team will be able to respond to each submission individually, but it would be helpful if they provided summaries of trends in user feedback and how it is informing the design and development of the project. This could go a long way to prevent users from perceiving that their concerns are being buried.</p>\n<p>Version 1.3 also adds expandable panels to the block inspector, support for pasting plain text markdown content (and converting it to blocks), and accessibility improvements to the color palette component.

Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.9, try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.9-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.9 is slated for release on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-9/\">November 14</a>, but we need your help to get there. We’ve been working on making it even easier to customize your site. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drafting (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\">#39896</a>) and scheduling (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\">#28721</a>) of changes in the Customizer. Once you save or schedule a changeset, when any user comes into the Customizer the pending changes will be autoloaded. A button is provided to discard changes to restore the Customizer to the last published state. (This is a new “linear” mode for changesets, as opposed to “branching” mode which can be enabled by filter so that every time  user opens the Customizer a new blank changeset will be started.)</li>\n<li>Addition of a frontend preview link to the Customizer to allow changes to be browsed on the frontend, even without a user being logged in (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\">#39896</a>).</li>\n<li>Addition of autosave revisions in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39275\">#39275</a>).</li>\n<li>A brand new theme browsing experience in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37661\">#37661</a>).</li>\n<li>Gallery widget (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41914\">#41914</a>), following the media and image widgets introduced in 4.8.</li>\n<li>Support for shortcodes in Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10457\">#10457</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for adding media to Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40854\">#40854</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for adding oEmbeds outside post content, including Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34115\">#34115</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for videos from providers other than YouTube and Vimeo in the Video widget (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42039\">#42039</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve the flow for creating new menus in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40104\">#40104</a>).</li>\n<li>Educated guess mapping of nav menus and widgets when switching themes (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39692\">#39692</a>).</li>\n<li>Plugins: Introduce singular capabilities for activating and deactivating individual plugins (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38652\">#38652</a>).</li>\n<li>Sandbox PHP file edits in both plugins and themes, without auto-deactivation when an error occurs; a PHP edit that introduces a fatal error is rolled back with an opportunity then for the user to fix the error and attempt to re-save.

Integration includes support for linters to catch errors before you attempt to save. Includes new APIs for plugins to instantiate editors. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423\">#12423</a>)</li>\n<li>Introduction of an extensible code editor control for adding instances of CodeMirror to the Customizer. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41897\">#41897</a>)</li>\n<li>Addition of global notifications area (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35210\">#35210</a>), panel and section notifications (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38794\">#38794</a>), and a notification overlay that takes over the entire screen in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37727\">#37727</a>).</li>\n<li>A date/time control in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42022\">#42022</a>).</li>\n<li>Improve usability of Customize JS API (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42083\">#42083</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37964\">#37964</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36167\">#36167</a>).</li>\n<li>Introduction of control templates for base controls (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30738\">#30738</a>).</li>\n<li>Use WP_Term_Query when transforming tax queries (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37038\">#37038</a>).</li>\n<li>Database: Add support for MySQL servers connecting to IPv6 hosts (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41722\">#41722</a>).</li>\n<li>Emoji: Bring Twemoji compatibility to PHP (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35293\">#35293</a>). Test for any weirdness with emoji in RSS feeds or emails.</li>\n<li>I18N: Introduce the Plural_Forms class (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41562\">#41562</a>).</li>\n<li>Media: Upgrade MediaElement.js to 4.2.5-74e01a40 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39686\">#39686</a>).</li>\n<li>Media: Use max-width for default captions (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33981\">#33981</a>).

Version 5.4 adds the architecture for the feature, which is powered by Elasticsearch and runs in the WordPress.com cloud. Users who want to participate in the beta can enable the feature at Settings > Traffic on WordPress.com and then add the new Search widget within wp-admin.</p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; native search function is notoriously slow and often provides poor and inadequate results for sites with large amounts of content. Jetpack&#8217;s new Search module aims to deliver faster, more relevant results using the same powerful infrastructure that runs Jetpack Related Posts and the search on hundreds of WordPress.com VIP sites. In July 2017, WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/07/11/real-time-elasticsearch-indexing-on-wordpress-com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data.blog</a> reported that its network averages 23 million actions per day that trigger indexing of 75 million Elasticsearch documents into hundreds of indices.</p>\n<p>Jetpack Search boasts a zero configuration setup, real-time indexing (WordPress.com&#8217;s VIP indices have a one-second refresh rate), and the flexibility for developers to create custom Elasticsearch queries.</p>\n<p>The Jetpack Professional plan&#8217;s $299/year price point is highly competitive for access to a hosted Elasticsearch engine. Ordinarily, developers looking for the most economical way to implement Elasticsearch on a WordPress site will have to host and manage their own instances on Amazon AWS or other cloud services. This often comes with more ongoing maintenance and setup.</p>\n<p>Most managed WordPress hosts do not have a hosted Elasticsearch solution built into their plans. Earlier this year 10up launched <a href=\"http://ElasticPress.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ElasticPress.io</a> to fill this need for for enterprise clients. The service starts at $299/month for up to 20GB of storage and unlimited Elasticsearch bandwidth and goes up to $999/month for more resources.

But my dream since I left Colombia was to study Psychology. After about two years, I quit my job and went back to college. It was not an easy decision, but it never is, is it?</p>\n<p>My interest in starting this new career was to work in Clinical Psychology and Psychopathology. However, as far as I continued with my degree, I was finding subjects that put in doubt what I really wanted to work in the future. Health and Occupational Psychology was one of them.</p>\n<h3>Finding a Purpose</h3>\n<p>At that time I was still living in Paris with my husband, Andrés Cifuentes, a chemical engineer who ended up doing a master&#8217;s degree in web programming. Afterwards he became a WordPress enthusiast and nowadays he works within the WordPress ecosystem. Back then, while he spent his free time getting to know and learn more about WordPress (I didn’t know at that time that I was discovering WordPress too!) he listened to different podcasts and many of them addressed issues of the problems that remote workers had to face.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All of these people in the podcasts mentioned burnout as a result of their work and what they suffered for it. It was at that moment that I made the connection; I had found what I wanted to do.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The same day I started to investigate more about remote work and its impact on stress and burnout on the web (blogs, articles, essays).</p>\n<h3>Putting It Into Action</h3>\n<p>When time came to start my master I presented my project to my thesis director: I wanted to establish a relationship between remote work and burnout. Although he accepted my first subject of study, there was a long path waiting before establishing and defining my research area.</p>\n<p>Getting into the first steps of the research, I started an arduous research work of the literature review on remote work, which turned out being quite frustrating, as I could not find any scientific paper for my study on the subject. The only helpful information I could find was the research that had been done on telework, which was the closest type to remote work although it was not good enough.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as a requirement for the master, I had to find an internship in a company, so I spent hours and hours writing cover letters and applying to boring internship offers which practically wanted the interns to make coffee. Nice!</p>\n<p>Fortunately, my husband had the wonderful idea for me to apply to companies working with WordPress. Since those companies are mostly 100% remote, this would help with my research along with having personal experience on remote work myself.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lucky me! I had the great opportunity to do my internship in Human Made.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My proposal was to do a psychosocial risk assessment in the company that would also serve for my study. They were very kind to me and welcomed me warmly. No doubt they are a great company, Tom Wilmot truly cares for the wellbeing of his Humans and among themselves they help each other a lot, which for me is the basis of the success of the company&#8217;s growth. I really hope they have learned as much as I did.</p>\n<h3>Narrowing Focus</h3>\n<p>For several months I delivered to my thesis director about 8 different projects that I had find interesting to work on the remote work (stress, social support, culture differences, coping strategies, communication, isolation, identity…) all of them without success. My director disapproved each one of them as remote work in general is too extensive and scattered for a master thesis and I had to focus on a smaller group.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As I was doing my internship at Human Made, I thought it was a good idea to focus my study on the same subject but only within the WordPress community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was perfect since there have been no studies in this field in the WordPress community! Since WordPress project volunteers are the driving force behind the project, it has become particularly important to focus more on their psychological well-being.</p>\n<p>I sent the new thesis project about the role of motivation on burnout into the WordPress Community to my director and my research protocol was finally approved!</p>\n<h3>Studying The WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>WordPress is a community I&#8217;ve known for years thanks to my husband and I got closer to it with the time. My first contribution was to the Polyglots Team, he taught me how to start contributing and translating. He motivated me to give talks in WordCamps, something that I was very afraid of but I took it as an opportunity to share what I have learned about stress. I end up contributing with a couple of talks in WordCamp Sevilla and Barcelona about stress and remote work. Recently, I volunteered at past WordCamp Europe 2017.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have met wonderful people from whom I have learned so much in the WordPress community, I never thought that I would ended up being part of this community myself!</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, in the end, for me it is more exciting to do my research on the WordPress community because I have a lot of affection for it. And there are so many more things to investigate!<br />\nMy purpose is to contribute with this ecosystem improving its well-being.</p>\n<p>For the moment, I am working on the survey data of my current research and I am looking forward to sharing the results with the WordPress community!</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: WordPress Research Behind The Scenes\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=WordPress%20Research%20Behind%20The%20Scenes&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-research-behind-scenes%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: WordPress Research Behind The Scenes\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-research-behind-scenes%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-research-behind-scenes%2F&title=WordPress+Research+Behind+The+Scenes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: WordPress Research Behind The Scenes\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-research-behind-scenes/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/100417-min-150x150.jpg&description=WordPress Research Behind The Scenes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: WordPress Research Behind The Scenes\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-research-behind-scenes/\" title=\"WordPress Research Behind The Scenes\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-research-behind-scenes/\">WordPress Research Behind The Scenes</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Oct 2017 00:00:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Catalina Alvarez\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Drupal Core Maintainers Propose Adopting React for Administrative UI’s\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75269\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/drupal-core-maintainers-propose-adopting-react-for-administrative-uis\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6627:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/drupal_logo-blue.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Both the Drupal and WordPress communities are now knee-deep in weighing JavaScript frameworks to modernize underlying architecture for building user interfaces in 2018 and beyond. Yesterday Drupal founder Dries Buytaert <a href=\"https://dri.es/drupal-looking-to-adopt-react\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published a summary</a> of his discussions with core committers, framework managers, JavaScript subsystem maintainers, and JavaScript experts at DrupalCon Vienna. Together they concluded that Drupal should consider adopting React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We agreed that today, React would be the most promising option given its expansive adoption by developers, its unopinionated and component-based nature, and its well-suitedness to building new Drupal interfaces in an incremental way,&#8221; Buytaert said. &#8220;Today, I&#8217;m formally proposing that the Drupal community adopt React, after discussion and experimentation has taken place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2913321\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> is now available to the broader Drupal community and Buytaert&#8217;s recommendation during his keynote presentation in Vienna was to test and research how Drupal&#8217;s administrative UX could be improved by using a JavaScript framework.</p>\n<p>Two years ago Drupal explored adopting a JavaScript framework and at that time Buytaert was considering React, Ember, and Angular. Facebook&#8217;s patent clause in React&#8217;s licensing made him hesitant to want to pursue it for Drupal but the license has since been changed to MIT. The Drupal community was not eager to select a framework at that time and in response Buytaert opted to focus on improving <a href=\"https://dri.es/tag/web-services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal&#8217;s web service APIs</a> instead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By not committing to a specific framework, we are seeing Drupal developers explore a range of JavaScript frameworks and members of multiple JavaScript framework communities consuming Drupal&#8217;s web services,&#8221; Buytaert said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen Drupal 8 used as a content repository behind Angular, Ember, React, Vue, and other JavaScript frameworks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Buytaert shared an illustration showing how he envisions Drupal &#8220;supporting a variety of JavaScript libraries on the user-facing front end while relying on a single shared framework as a standard across Drupal administrative interfaces.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/drupal-supporting-different-javascript-front-ends.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This approach is similar to what WordPress&#8217; Gutenberg contributors are proposing with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">framework-agnostic block interoperability</a> where core would adopt a framework internally but developers could extend the new editor (and other UIs) using any JS library they prefer. In addition to giving developers more flexibility, this approach also helps to protect the project from the effects of the rapid pace at which JavaScript frameworks and libraries are coming and going.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Several years later, we still don&#8217;t know what JavaScript framework will win, if any, and I&#8217;m willing to bet that waiting two more years won&#8217;t give us any more clarity,&#8221; Buytaert said. &#8220;JavaScript frameworks will continue to evolve and take new shapes. Picking a single one will always be difficult and to some degree &#8216;premature.&#8217; That said, I see React having the most momentum today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2913321\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> on Drupal.org, authored by Lauri Eskola, Dupal&#8217;s core framework manager who specializes in JavaScript, said contributors&#8217; discussions revealed &#8220;unanimous consensus&#8230;that React would be a good choice.&#8221; Eskola cited several benefits they believe React will bring to Drupal, including its large ecosystem of libraries, active developer community, project maturity, and improved career options for classical Drupal developers. WordPress.com, TYPO3, The New York Times, Airbnb, and others using React were also listed among React&#8217;s benefits.</p>\n<p>The discussion on the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2913321\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> is an interesting read with many similarities to the recent discussions in the WordPress community regarding React. Several Drupal developers expressed concerns about how difficult it may be for those with a PHP background to learn React, as it adds more complexity to the development process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall I&#8217;m in favor of a framework,&#8221; Drual developer Mark Miller <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2913321#comment-12283495\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;However, a big question for me is how many PHP developers are going to easily pick up React? I know we want to bring in more Javascript developers, but it seems that most people creating modules and using this will be coming from a PHP background. I know pure JavaScript people love React, but it will likely be a steep curve to others in Drupal&#8217;s already steep learning curve.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Others, who had previously become disillusioned by a perception of Drupal being unable to keep up with modern web development, welcome the proposal to experiment with React. A few advocated for their frameworks of choice and said they would like to see the experimentation expanded to include other frameworks as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is there an issue yet for the React prototype of the watchdog page?&#8221; Drupal core committer Angie Byron said. &#8220;When that&#8217;s created, folks interested in alternative frameworks (I&#8217;m hearing both &#8216;vanilla&#8217; web components and Vue.js come up a lot, both here and in the WP discussions) could start an alternate implementation in a duplicate issue and we could compare/contrast, which would be very helpful in my opinion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Drupal is aiming to have enough real-world testing done to make a final decision before the upcoming 8.6.0 development period slated for the first part of 2018. Buytaert said that after deciding on a framework, Drupal&#8217;s leadership plans to begin adoption in a limited and incremental way &#8220;so that the decision is easily reversible if better approaches come later on.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Oct 2017 23:04:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Regenerate Thumbnails Plugin Passes 5 Million Downloads, Rewrite in the Works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74186\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/regenerate-thumbnails-plugin-passes-5-million-downloads-rewrite-in-the-works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4603:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Regenerate Thumbnails</a>, written by prolific plugin developer <a href=\"https://alex.blog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Mills</a>, has passed 5 million downloads. The plugin was first released nearly a decade ago in August 2008 during the days of WordPress 2.6. Regenerate Thumbnails is used to retroactively generate new thumbnail sizes for past uploads. It has become an indispensable utility over the years, helping millions of users successfully transition between WordPress themes that have different featured image sizes.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/regenerate-thumbnails-v-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Regenerate Thumbnails version 1.0.0\n<p>&#8220;I was freelancing at the time and according to an ancient post on my blog, I apparently wrote it as a client needed the functionality,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember that though and I certainly never figured it&#8217;d be installed and activated on over a million sites like it is today!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Regenerate Thumbnails is downloaded thousands of times every day, and, fortunately, it is the type of plugin that doesn&#8217;t generate too many support issues. Mills said he is thankful for the many volunteers on the WordPress.org support forums who have also helped manage the load. Despite the continued and widespread use of the plugin, Mills has never considered cashing in on it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never monetize any of my plugins,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I write them for fun not profit. It would be a conflict of interest anyway due to my employment at Automattic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Regenerate Thumbnails is a fairly straightforward plugin that rarely requires updating, but this year Mills said he has tried to give it a lot more love and will soon be releasing a complete rewrite.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rewrite is currently taking place on <a href=\"https://github.com/Viper007Bond/regenerate-thumbnails\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and is a complete rethink of the plugin, both in terms of the interface and underlying technologies,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;The interface is powered by Vue.js, which I&#8217;m learning and using for the first time, and the WordPress REST API. I also have a full suite of unit tests for PHPUnit to verify that the plugin code is working as intended, both now and into the future. Those have been incredibly useful while writing the plugin and I highly recommend other plugin authors make use of them too. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/plugin-unit-tests/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WP-CLI makes it very easy to set up</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After nine years of supporting Regenerate Thumbnails, and many other plugins, Mills said he doesn&#8217;t consider himself the best example when it comes to maintaining plugins. His advice to other developers is &#8220;try to make sure to write your plugins to be future-proof.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Outside of some updates last month, the last real changes to the plugin were made in 2012!&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;I wrote the plugin well the first time around and it&#8217;s just worked mostly fine ever since because it uses built-in WordPress code to do the work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the reason why Regenerate Thumbnails has already blazed past its major milestone at 5,762,713 downloads and is well on its way to 6 million before the end of the year. Users still find the plugin to work as reliably as it did in 2008.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Have loved this plugin for years, just used it to relaunch a website with 50000 images and 30 image sizes.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Scott Fennell (@scottfennell123) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottfennell123/status/896933624657756160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 14, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mills said that making a plugin future proof is key if you write code all day for a living and then find it difficult to write more in the evenings and weekends for WordPress.org plugins. However, due to his current illness, he hasn&#8217;t worked in nearly a year since October 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;m still battling the leukemia, I&#8217;m at least feeling better than I was at the beginning of the year so I&#8217;ve gotten the itch to code again,&#8221; Mills said. &#8220;Working on personal projects such as Regenerate Thumbnails has been a good way to brush off my coding skills in anticipation of returning to work.

Checksums are a method of verifying the integrity of files. Three years ago, WP-CLI added the capability of verifying WordPress core checksums using the MD5 algorithm. This is a useful security feature that allows developers to easily see if any files have been modified or compromised.</p>\n<p>The core checksums are handled via WordPress&#8217; official API (https://api.wordpress.org/core/checksums/) and WP-CLI contributors are planning to extend this infrastructure to plugins and themes hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having this kind of functionality for plugins and themes as well would be a huge security benefit,&#8221; WP-CLI co-maintainer Alain Schlesser said. &#8220;It would allow you to check the file integrity of an entire site, possibly in an automated fashion. However, there is no centralized way of retrieving the file checksums for plugins or themes yet, and the alternative of downloading the plugins and themes from the official servers first just to check against them is wasteful in terms of resources and bandwidth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors are currently exploring different options for implementation in a <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/ideas/issues/6\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discussion on GitHub</a>, inspired by an existing <a href=\"https://github.com/eriktorsner/wp-checksum\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wp-checksum project</a> by Erik Torsner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The simplest possible infrastructure to go with would be flat files (no database),&#8221; WP-CLI maintainer Daniel Bachhuber said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve chatted with the corresponding WordPress.org folks about hosting. If our middleware application can generate flat files served by some API, then it will be fine to sync those flat files to a WordPress.org server (with rsync or similar).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team is considering building the API under a separate URL for testing and iteration and then incorporating it back into WordPress.org&#8217;s infrastructure once it is ready. However, the sheer size of the SVN checkouts and the CPU required to sync the files makes it an interesting challenge. DreamHost has volunteered a server for the team to run its checksum generator on while the infrastructure is being developed.</p>\n<p>Torsner&#8217;s WP-CLI subcommand to verify checksums for themes and plugins currently only works with those hosted on WordPress.org, but he is also experimenting with mechanisms for getting checksums from some commercial vendors, including Gravity Forms and Easy Digital Downloads. He said he hopes the project would be capable of keeping these capabilities for commercial plugins after it is incorporated back into WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The Plugin and Themes Checksums project is currently in the initiation stage and will have an official kickofff during the next WP-CLI meeting on <a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20171003T1600\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tuesday, October 3, 2017, at 11:00 AM CDT</a>.

There have also been some intriguing changes in the WordCamp program, so read on to learn more about the WordPress community during the month of September.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>JavaScript Frameworks in WordPress</h2>\n<p>Early in the month, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\">Matt Mullenweg announced</a> that WordPress will be switching away from React as the JavaScript library WordPress Core might use — this was in response to Facebook’s decision to keep a controversial patent clause in the library’s license, making many WordPress users uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>A few days later, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/facebook-dropping-patent-clause/\">Facebook reverted the decision</a>, making React a viable option for WordPress once more. Still, the WordPress Core team is exploring a move <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\">to make WordPress framework-agnostic</a>, so that the framework being used could be replaced by any other framework without affecting the rest of the project.</p>\n<p>This is a bold move that will ultimately make WordPress core a lot more flexible, and will also protect it from potential license changes in the future.</p>\n<p>You can get involved in the JavaScript discussion by joining the #core-js channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress

community member, Ines van Essen, started a new nonprofit initiative to offer financial assistance to community members to attend WordCamps. <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC</a> launched with a crowdsourced funding campaign to cover the costs of getting things up and running.</p>\n<p>Now that she’s raised the initial funds, Ines plans to set up a nonprofit organization and use donations from sponsors to help people all over the world attend and speak at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>If you would like to support the initiative, you can do so by <a

href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/\">the first WordCamp Incubator Program</a>, the Community Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/09/27/wordcamp-incubator-program-v2-new-role-name/\">bringing the program back</a> to assist more underserved cities in kick-starting their WordPress communities.</p>\n<p>The program’s first phase aims to find community members who will volunteer to mentor, assist, and work alongside local leaders in the incubator communities — this is a time-intensive volunteer role that would need to be filled by experienced WordCamp organizers.</p>\n<p>If you would like to be a part of this valuable initiative, join the #community-team channel in

contributors have not yet made a final decision on the JavaScript framework to adopt for core, but Gutenberg development continues on with <a

<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2708\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resolving block conflicts</a> when switching between the &#8220;classic editor&#8221; and Gutenberg. Previously, if a user had created some paragraph blocks in Gutenberg but switched to the classic editor, the tags would get stripped out, making those blocks invalid when moving back to Gutenberg. Version 1.2 merges a pull request that detects whether the post contains blocks and then disables the wpautop behavior in the classic editor to prevent it from stripping the tags.</p>\n<p>This release also offers initial <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2740\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">support for postmeta</a> in block attributes. Gutenberg contributor Gary Pendergast tweeted <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pento/19b35d621709042fc899e394a9387a54\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an example plugin</a> for those who want to experiment with it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just between us, the new Gutenberg 1.2 release includes the first version of postmeta support!

The value of knowing how many blocks are in play on the page or how many headings have been used is not immediately evident. It strikes me as a rather large and obtrusive display of non-essential information, which for some reason has been given priority placement at the top of the editor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-10.36.02-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg is getting ready to support metaboxes and this release adds a placeholder for the proposed Extended Settings panel.

For some editing workflows the information in meta boxes is actually critical, core content/settings, not something optional/added-on/extended. Is this editable? Can developers add additional sections of their own like this?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella acknowledged these concerns as legitimate and said the team is still exploring different options for the panel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the first iteration, we&#8217;ll probably keep the collapsed state but have multiple areas,&#8221; Benguella said. &#8220;There are some good design proposals dropping the expanding area (for the content area) and replacing them with &#8220;separators,&#8221; which might be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/952#issuecomment-312804592\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">good as a v2</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It may have seemed like Gutenberg development has been on hold due to the delayed JavaScript framework decision, but development is still ongoing. It slowed over the past couple weeks while most of the project&#8217;s chief contributors were attending the Automattic GM.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The framework decision doesn’t affect most Gutenberg development work &#8211; because the framework is hidden behind a compatibility layer, the majority of development work (at least, the work that touches the UI) can talk to the compatibility layer,&#8221; contributor Gary Pendergast said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are also large areas of code that don’t need the framework at all. For example, adding <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2740\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">postmeta support</a> was just about writing the glue between the Block API and the REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast said that even once a JavaScript framework decision is made, Gutenberg will only require one or two developers to work on the necessary changes, but all other contributors will be able to continue on without any issues.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Sep 2017 04:21:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"WPTavern: DigitalOcean Partners with GitHub to Support Open Source Projects during Hacktoberfest October 1–31\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75163\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://wptavern.com/digitalocean-partners-with-github-to-support-open-source-projects-during-hacktoberfest-october-1-31\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2705:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-29-at-12.29.22-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>DigitalOcean is organizing its fourth annual <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hacktoberfest</a> in partnership with GitHub.

Peter is a web developer from the Land of the Danes. He is the creator of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github\" target=\"_blank\">WP Pusher</a> and a huge travel addict, bringing his work along with him as he goes.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Have you ever done this?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/file-versions.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Most of us have.</p>\n<p>Do you know what the technical term for it is? <em>Version control</em>. Your own, homemade, delicious implementation of version control!</p>\n<p>Okay, how about this?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/commented-code.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version control right there!</p>\n<p>What I’m trying to show with these two examples is that all developers use some sort of version control. Some use Ctrl-z to roll back to a previous version, some use a zipped backup in a Dropbox folder and some use a dedicated version control system (VCS), such as Git. All the things we are trying to accomplish by backing up our files, commenting out old code and stashing it away in another “final-FINAL” zipball has been taken care of already. All we need to do is to embrace these VCS tools that we have available in our tool belt.</p>\n<p>Git is not complicated to use. It might seem difficult and overwhelming but in your day to day life you will probably use a maximum of 3-4 different commands. Learning how to use 3-4 commands to properly have version control of every single change ever made to your code base is a great deal compared to the “final-FINAL” approach.</p>\n<p>Here’s what version control looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/version-control-intro.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This is a screenshot of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Git mirror on GitHub</a>. Every time a change is made to the code base, it is recorded with Git and there is no need to copy the whole code base, throwing it into another folder, zipping it and naming it “final-FINAL-F-I-N-A-L”. If you dive into the WordPress code base on GitHub, you can find <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/23f1a9d2a4e9b484290f130e6c80e38e7fdcd453\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commits dating back to 2003</a>, made by “someone” named saxmatt!</p>\n<p>Let’s dive into one of these commits, as they are called in Git:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/commit.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This is the diff (Git jargon for difference between 2 commits) for the “class-wp-widget-text.php” file. The red line is being replaced with the green line below it. No need to comment it out to save it for eternity, like in that other example. Git will do that for us and we can forever and always refer back to this commit to see what was replaced and with what.</p>\n<p>Of course, the full WordPress code base is a large project with many collaborators. However, no project is too small to benefit from Git. Once you master those 3-4 commands, using Git in your day-to-day developer life becomes second nature, just like hitting Ctrl-s. It might not be obvious right now, but when you pull out an old project months or years later, having version control helps you catch up and gives you the confidence to change things without fearing disaster.</p>\n<p>So I challenge you to learn Git! Not necessarily deeply, just a little bit.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 22:31:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Incubator Program Gears Up for Round 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75159\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-gears-up-for-round-2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2791:\"<p>Last year the WordPress Community Team launched an experimental <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-launch-experimental-wordcamp-incubator-program\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Incubator program</a> to bring WordCamps to new cities where meetups had not been very well established. After receiving 182 applications, organizers narrowed the selections to three cities with the most potential to foster an emerging WordPress community. Successful WordCamps were held in Denpasar, Harare, and Medellín. Six additional communities that applied to the program ended up organizing WordCamps as well with the help of community mentors.</p>\n<p>This week Andrea Middleton announced that the Community Team will be pursuing <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/09/27/wordcamp-incubator-program-v2-new-role-name/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">round two of the WordCamp Incubator program</a>. Given the rapid growth of the global WordPress community, Middleton said the greatest challenge to getting the program running again is finding people who can oversee the new WordCamps. The full-time sponsored volunteer staff from the previous year is already fully committed for 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a time-intensive volunteer role,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;We estimate that lead organizers spend about 170 hours on a WordCamp, and I figure that the folks working to support the growth of an Incubator event need to dedicate about 200-250 hours over the planning cycle. The job is that of co-organizer, mentor, and ambassador — since it’s probable that no one you’re working with has ever actually attended a WordCamp.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Experience having organized WordCamps is a prerequisite for taking on the community advisor role. Middleton also emphasized the importance of sensitivity and experience collaborating with people from other cultures. She estimates the volunteer role is likely to require 25 hours per month. As this is almost a part-time job, the Community Team is looking at the possibility of having interested volunteers pitch their companies to sponsor some of their hours to work on the incubator program. They are also considering creating a team of incubator advisors to work together assisting multiple communities.</p>\n<p>The team is aiming to decide on a name for the advisor role and come up with a plan for recruiting volunteers by October 6. This will be followed by a call for communities that would like to be considered for the program and host their first WordCamp in 2018.

In May 2017, the service reported <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-500-million-new-sharing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">500 million monthly users</a> backing up more than 1.2 billion photos and videos per day.</p>\n<p>When inserting pictures on WordPress.com, users can also take advantage of Google&#8217;s smart image searching capabilities. The service is fairly good at recognizing what is in your images and where they were taken, even if you haven&#8217;t specifically categorized them or added descriptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-3.46.51-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The new Google Photos integration is also available for Jetpack-enabled sites when posting via the WordPress.com interface. (It is not available in wp-admin of self-hosted sites.) Unfortunately, this experience is still rather buggy. After adding photos, WordPress.com didn&#8217;t seem to be able to save drafts and it was also unable to display the most recent photos from the past week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-1.44.52-PM-e1506544898526.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Users should also note that when you authenticate with Google Photos, it will open access to the photos from every single site that you have connected to that particular WordPress.com account. This access is, however, is limited to the specific user who connected. Multiple users on a site will each need to authenticate separately and can connect their own Google accounts. The users do not have access to each other&#8217;s photos. It&#8217;s also easy to revoke access at <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/sharing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.com/sharing</a>.</p>\n<p>The new Google Photos feature has been very well received by WordPress.com users, as it saves them the trouble of downloading images from the service and then uploading to their media libraries. It&#8217;s not quite as convenient for Jetpack-enabled sites, because it adds additional steps to the publishing process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Excellent feature, but will it be available directly from self-hosted sites without using WordPress.com?&#8221; one user asked. &#8220;This cuts out so many steps in our publishing workflow, but then adds several more if we then need to login to WordPress.com to do this. Our admin setup is complex, so switching to editing here isn’t an option. I have multiple contributors who write directly and this would be a game changer if they could directly upload their images from their account.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A WordPress.com representative confirmed that there are currently no plans to support a standalone version in Jetpack. They are, however, looking at supporting other services, such as Flickr, in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 22:17:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: Camp Press – A Detox from Digital Life\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75139\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/camp-press-a-detox-from-digital-life\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3381:\"<p>The following is a guest post by Brad Williams who shares his experience at <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">Camp Press</a> this past weekend. Brad is the Co-Founder and CEO of the website design and development agency <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com\">WebDevStudios</a>.</p>\n<p>He is also a co-author of the Professional WordPress book series. Brad is a US Marine Corps veteran and has been developing websites for over 20 years, including the last 10 where he has focused on open-source technologies like WordPress.</p>\n<hr />\n<img />Brad Williams at Camp Press\n<p>I’ve been to a number of WordCamps and tech-related events over the years. They all follow a similar pattern of speakers, panels, sponsors, after-parties, etc. We’ve all been to these types of events and generally know what to expect; so when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ifyouwillit?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Mendel Kurland</a> pitched the idea of <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">Camp Press</a> to me as &#8216;geeks camping,&#8217; I was intrigued.</p>\n<p>I went to Camp Press with no idea of what to expect. I honestly have never felt less prepared for an event as I did for this one. I like to plan. So, going to an event where I wasn’t 100% sure how it would work had me feeling nervous. What I soon realized is that I liked being pushed out of my &#8216;safety bubble.&#8217;</p>\n<p>The Camp Press location was absolutely amazing and truly helped make the event special. We stayed at a large summer camp style setup, about an hour outside of Oklahoma City called Fry Lake. If you aren’t familiar with Oklahoma, just imagine driving an hour from a large city to the middle of nowhere. Perfect.</p>\n<p>Fry Lake had cabins, shower and bathroom facilities, an amazing swimming lake with diving boards, and a full cafeteria kitchen. We were literally back at the type of summer camp we experienced as kids, and we immediately knew it.</p>\n<img />Camp Press Fire\n<p>As we learned more about each other, we quickly became more comfortable as a group. We shared stories, laughed, cooked, and debated topics from tech to TV shows. We discussed very personal struggles and experiences, some of which I would guess haven’t been shared outside of close family. We sang songs around the campfire, performed late-night improv, made s’mores, and enjoyed each other’s company.</p>\n<p>Even more amazing is that nothing was scripted. There was no agenda, set activities, presentations. It was just natural interaction. Over the course of a few days, we all grew closer to each other. There was an unspoken bond forming between everyone at Camp Press.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know what to expect going to <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">Camp Press</a>. What I promptly learned is that was the entire point of the event—doing the unexpected, pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, making new friends, having fun and serious conversations, and doing all of this without the normal technology that is always around us.</p>\n<p>When is the last time you had a detox from digital life? My detox was last weekend, and I can’t wait to do it again!</p>\n<img />Camp Press Attendees\n<p>For more insight into Camp Press and to get Mendel&#8217;s perspective, check out the event&#8217;s <a

September 30 2017, the WordPress Polyglots Team &#8211; whose mission is to translate WordPress into as many languages as possible &#8211; will hold its third <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">Global WordPress Translation Day</a>, a 24-hour, round-the-clock, digital and physical global marathon dedicated to the localisation and internationalisation of the WordPress platform and ecosystem, a structure that powers, today, over 28% of all existing websites.</span></p>\n<p><span>The localisation process allows for WordPress and for all WordPress-related products (themes and plugins) to be available in local languages, so to improve their accessibility and usage and to allow as many people as possible to take advantage of the free platform and services available.</span></p>\n<p><span>In a (not completely) serendipitous coincidence, September 30 has also been declared by the United Nations “International Translation Day”, to pay homage to the great services of translators everywhere, one that allows communication and exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span>The event will feature a series of multi-language live speeches (training sessions, tutorials, case histories, etc.) that will be screen-casted in streaming, starting from Australia and the Far East and ending in the Western parts of the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span>In that same 24-hour time frame, Polyglots worldwide will gather physically in local events, for dedicated training and translations sprints (and for some fun and socializing as well), while those unable to physically join their teams will do so remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span>A big, fun, useful and enlightening party and a lovely mix of growing, giving, learning and teaching, to empower, and cultivate, and shine.</span></p>\n<p><span>Here are some stats about the first two events:</span></p>\n<p><b>Global WordPress Translation Day 1</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>   </span><span>448 translators worldwide</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>50 local events worldwide</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>54 locales involved</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>40350 strings translated, in</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>597 projects</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Global WordPress Translation Day 2</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>   </span><span>780 translators worldwide</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>67 local events worldwide</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>133 locales

news and in reaching out to all four corners of the world to make the third #WPTranslationDay a truly amazing one and to help celebrate the unique and fundamental role that translators have in the Community but also in all aspects of life.</span></p>\n<p><span>A full press release is available, along with more information and visual assets at </span><a

imagined that WordPress would become an important part of my life.\" /><p>I grew up in a suburb to Stockholm, where me and my brothers would wrestle over who was allowed to use our first PC. I think it was a pre-owned old beaten Compaq Deskpro 386. We only stopped arguing once we could sit down together and play Civ; one of us at the controls, the others giving advice on what moves to make.</p>\n<h3>Dipping Into The Web</h3>\n<p>I learnt HTML and built my first pages on Geocities and out of necessity: I needed a place to publish my angsty teenage poetry. But people didn’t come to my website for the bad poetry, instead they filled my guestbook with webdesign and HTML questions.</p>\n<p>I have built websites for myself and others since the mid 90’s and kept a few clients on the side while studying. At this time, there was not a lot of computer or programming classes available for high school students. It had been easy enough to learn HTML online by reading guides, message boards and similar. During one of my final semesters, my school announced a new class called “Computers for girls”. I signed up hoping to learn enough to assemble or upgrade my own PC. The class was a joke. Instead of teaching us about motherboards, memory or networks, our teacher showed us where to put the cords…</p>\n<p>He didn’t realise that most of us already spent every recess in the computer halls, chatting over IRC. In order to learn the basics of actual programming (not just HTML), I had to take adult education evening- and summer classes since my school didn’t offer any.</p>\n<h3>Derailed</h3>\n<p>After high school I did like many others of my generation: I fell in love with someone I had only met online, who lived on the other side of the world. All to the soundtrack of Savage Garden&#8217;s “I Knew I Loved You”.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"></div>\n<p>It took all my savings and courage to travel back and forward between Sweden and the US, while studying from a distance.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When my boyfriend suddenly passed away in 2001 I had to make drastic changes in my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was in the middle of moving, I couldn’t keep up with deadlines or deal with clients, and I was barely able to finish my project managing and programming classes. I had to forget all our plans, start over, and take a desk job instead.</p>\n<h3>Coming Back To The Web</h3>\n<p>Many years later one of my former clients asked if I had tried WordPress. It took me a few months to decide if I liked it or not, partially because I didn’t know PHP, and because I didn’t have great experiences from trying Joomla and Drupal.</p>\n<p>I did some customization work and eventually I submitted my first theme to WordPress.org. Of course my theme was a mess and did not even work as expected.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I appreciated that someone took the time to look at my code and explain what I needed to do to fix it and where I could read more. It was very rare to receive such feedback.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I joined the Theme Review Team&#8217;s mailing list, listening in and learning. I started reviewing themes to learn more and to improve my own themes.</p>\n<p>For those who do not know what the Theme Review Team does, we test and review the code (every single file) of themes that are submitted to be included in the WordPress.org theme directory.</p>\n<h3>My Secret Power</h3>\n<p>Because I am on the autism spectrum, the structure and patterns of coding languages suits me well. I need both structure and a creative outlet in my life, and coding is therapy, much like a puzzle or a coloring book. I love my once dreaded desk job, because it gives me the opportunity to help people on a different scale than I ever could as a freelancer. Being a volunteer on WordPress.org lets me combine both worlds.</p>\n<p>I could never have imagined that WordPress would become an important part of my life, that I would spend this much time on it (sometimes up to 20 hours per week), or that I would be asked to be one of the team leads for the Theme Review Team in 2017.</p>\n<p>Today I honestly don’t know what I would do if I could no longer contribute to WordPress the way I know and am familiar with. It is an essential part of my everyday life.</p>\n<p>WordPress is also challenging because you can only do so much without interacting with others… And even though I find that difficult, I have had to learn that it is something I need as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have to remind myself from time to time that here, I am allowed to be myself, with all my flaws, to contribute as much or as little as I choose, at my own pace.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And to be able to contribute and to help others, I also have to remind myself that people are not scary.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>I was a volunteer online for 6 years before I had the courage to go to my first WordCamp, which took place in my own home town. When I was finally there, I only spoke to 3 or 4 people. My second WordCamp went better, but the experience was still overwhelming.</p>\n<p>During my third WordCamp, which was WCEU 2017, I helped lead the Theme Review section of the contributor day, having to speak in front of 500 people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The thing is, even when it overwhelms you, this community and its energy is addicting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Everything changes once you go to your first meetup or WordCamp, meeting people who share your interest and passion. The community at large is open and welcoming, passionate, curious and caring. And it is trying to be a safe place for us all.</p>\n<h3>The Theme Review Team</h3>\n<p>There always seem to be a lot of opinions and even controversy surrounding the Theme Review Team. It is not always easy to handle the pressure and the amount of responsibility that is placed on you because so many people have a financial interest in WordPress themes. As a team lead or moderator, you often have to try to find the least bad solution to many different kind of situations.</p>\n<p>By the end of September, it is time for the current team leads to step back and welcome our next leads. I am looking forward to the break, but also to see what new ideas they will bring.<br />\nIt takes time to change a system that has been in place for this many years, and truthfully, sometimes it is painfully slow. It has proven difficult to find a system where themes without errors can be added to the directory quickly, and where reviewers can support authors who need extra help.</p>\n<p>This amazing team of volunteers has managed to reduce the queue time from 7 months down to 8-10 weeks. We still hope to be able to reduce it further, possibly by automating parts of the code review.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Theme Review Team is open to everyone and always looking for new volunteers.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Challenge Gladly Accepted\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Challenge%20Gladly%20Accepted&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Challenge Gladly Accepted\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F&title=Challenge+Gladly+Accepted\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Challenge Gladly Accepted\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/092717-150x150.jpg&description=Challenge Gladly Accepted\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Challenge Gladly Accepted\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/\" title=\"Challenge Gladly Accepted\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/\">Challenge Gladly Accepted</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 00:00:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Carolina Nymark\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"WPTavern: WordPress Core JavaScript Framework Selection Discussion Continues with Input from Open Source Community Leaders\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75086\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:133:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-selection-discussion-continues-with-input-from-open-source-community-leaders\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10632:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/javascript.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; #core-js Slack channel hosted a lively and productive meeting this morning led by Andrew Duthie. The discussion focused less on specific framework comparisons and more on the role a framework will play in building JavaScript-powered interfaces for WordPress. Contributors were joined by core developers and leaders from the React and Vue communities, Chrome engineers, and other interested parties from outside the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This chat will focus largely on identifying requirements in building core features, overlap with plugin and theme authors, and patterns to reducing framework lock-in,&#8221; Duthie said. &#8220;Ideally this is higher-level than simply debating the merits of specific frameworks in a vacuum, and should be seen as an opportunity to collaborate between projects to set a path forward for WordPress which will provide flexibility and resiliency to future churn.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Duthie began by asking what role a framework should play in a WordPress developer&#8217;s workflow and also asked framework contributors to offer their perspectives on recommendations for extendable interfaces. This question provided attendees with the opportunity to weigh in on topics such as <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2791\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">support for web components</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">framework-agnostic block interoperability</a> for Gutenberg, and how this might affect WordPress&#8217; plugin ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I disagree a bit with the idea that whatever core (in this case Gutenberg) uses to power some of the intricacies of building a stateful app is going to be the de facto standard for plugin development,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Matías Ventura said. &#8220;The actual framework here, in general terms, is going to be what WordPress exposes and the APIs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks, the library that core decides to build on doesn&#8217;t have to become the de facto standard for plugin developers but many outside the Gutenberg team believe that it will inevitably end up that way in practice. There are entire teams of engineers waiting on this decision that are committed to adopt whichever framework WordPress bets on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To provide some perspective on how WP’s decision on a framework impacts developers downstream, I’m a developer at Boston University and our plan is to focus on whichever framework WP decides upon, even if Gutenberg has a completely agnostic API,&#8221; Adam Pieniazek said. &#8220;We’re primarily a WP shop (~ 1,000 site WP install powers most/a lot of our public web presence) and end up creating huge customizations on top of WP that often require diving into core to see what is actually happening in the background. I like Vue more than React personally, but if WP decides upon React, BU will focus on building expertise in React for when we need to peek/debug beyond the API. It doesn’t mean we won’t also use Vue but it won’t be our primary focus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pieniazek feedback echoes that of Gravity Forms co-founder Carl Hancock, who said his team is ready to adopt whatever library WordPress selects.</p>\n<p>“People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,” Hancock said in the #core-js channel earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Many participants from outside the WordPress community seemed to be in agreement with a framework-agnostic approach and none were eager to force a single framework on all developers working with WordPress. The remaining concern is how this works out practically and whether it puts developers in the confusing position of using a framework on top of a framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Gutenberg itself is going to become a platform to build for, the best level of separation is if the framework is used to build the core, but isn’t exposed as API to block builders,&#8221; AMP engineer Paul Bakaus said. &#8220;This gives one the choice to replace the underlying foundation whenever necessary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella summarized the approach the team has been discussing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think what we try to communicate is something like:</p>\n<p>&#8211; WordPress Core is going to use this X framework internally<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use it, we think it’s good<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use something else, you can just as easily as you’d use the Core’s chosen framework</p></blockquote>\n<p>Benguella also said that one of the goals for Gutenberg is &#8220;to set the basis for how we extend WordPress&#8217; UI in the future.&#8221; Once it ships, the team will likely set its sights on other parts of the wp-admin and build them in the same way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all parts of WP’s UI can be extended via a standard interface, whether it be a simple &#8216;data down, events up&#8217; API, or expecting a WC, I think this would cleanly separate the concerns of &#8216;what framework to use for core&#8217; vs. &#8216;what framework to use for extension development,\'&#8221; Vue.js creator Evan You said.</p>\n<p>When asked for his thoughts on on React becoming a primary framework for WordPress, React maintainer Dan Abromov was hesitant to advocate for WordPress adopting the library. His response underscored the necessity of having a framework-agnostic approach for extending Gutenberg and future WP interface overhauls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know WordPress well, so it&#8217;s hard for me to say whether it&#8217;s a great fit for the use case or not,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;Generally we use React for highly interactive UIs and find that it scales well with the app size. I&#8217;m also happy to answer technical questions about it. But I think in general people have strong opinions about, for example, templating vs expressiveness, and I don&#8217;t feel like forcing React upon everyone is the best way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also feel the same way,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;Forcing a single framework on everyone, regardless of which one, is IMO not a good idea because it is bound to alienate the group of devs who are not into that framework, and imposes a bigger long term stability risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also said that people are already &#8220;very bitter and divisive&#8221; about the subject of selecting a framework. He also tweeted a similar sentiment prior to the meeting.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When I read discussion threads (e.g. about WordPress) there’s a sense that people perceive every team as hostile to others.

It’s just a matter of proper implementation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants referenced <a href=\"https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">custom-elements-everywhere.com</a>, a site that displays popular JS frameworks&#8217; progress on communicating Custom Elements in a way that promotes interoperability. Matías Ventura asked React and Vue core devs how web components (and their future) fit into each framework at the moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In React, we have some web component support but haven&#8217;t made it a large priority since use cases have seemed slim in the past, especially since adding Web Components hasn&#8217;t made a lot of sense in a first-party application where you control the whole stack – but we do have some support for them nonetheless and I&#8217;m happy to entertain adding more, either now or in the future,&#8221; Sophie Alpert said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the high level I think frameworks like React/Vue provide what is not really addressed in web components: efficient and declarative DOM updates reacting to state changes,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;This is also why Polymer exists on top of WC. I have always acknowledged the value of WC as an interop interface.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Overall, attendees at the meeting were respectful, collaborative, and eager to contribute their expertise to help WordPress contributors find the best way forward in the framework selection process. The discussion will continue at next week&#8217;s meeting and likely in the comments of a forthcoming Make/Core post summarizing the meeting.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 22:16:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Spam Code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75059\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/si-captcha-anti-spam-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-og-due-to-spam-code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4092:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam</a> plugin has been removed from the WordPress Directory due to its author including spam code. The plugin added a CAPTCHA image test to WordPress forms to prevent spam and was compatible with forms generated by bbPress, BuddyPress, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. It had more than 300,000 active installs at the time of removal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikechallis\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Challis</a>, the original author of the plugin, said that a WordPress.org user named &#8220;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/fastsecure\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fastsecure</a>&#8221; became the new owner of SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam in June 2017. Challis was not aware of the new owner&#8217;s plans for the plugin but <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted a notice</a> on the WordPress.org support forums to inform users about why it was removed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new owner attempted to put code in several of his newly acquired WordPress plugins that would connect to a 3rd party server he also owned and place spam ads for payday loans and such in the WP posts,&#8221; Challis said. He also linked the incident to a ring of WordPress plugins that researchers at Wordfence say were part of a <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/coordinated-plugin-spam/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coordinated spam campaign</a>. Display Widgets, one of the most notable plugins in this group, was recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">permanently removed from WordPress.org</a> for a series of violations wherein the author had injected malicious code.</p>\n<p>Challis said the new owner failed to display any spam on sites due to how the code was implemented, but the code could have been activated at a later time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The new owner put spam code in versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 but it failed to display any spam because he put the code in the secureimage.php file. The malicious code required WordPress libraries to also be loaded to execute. The reason the spam code did not do anything at all is because the secureimage.php file is not included in the WordPress run time environment. The secureimage.php file is included from another file securimage_show.php that loads the captcha image directly from html img src outside of the WordPress run time. The spam code in this plugin was never activated, it would not have corrupted your posts or changed anything in the WordPress database.</p></blockquote>\n<p>SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam users who still have the plugin installed may see an update available in the WordPress admin. Plugin team member Samuel (Otto) Wood removed the malicious code and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released 3.0.3</a> as a clean version that is a safe update for users who still rely on the plugin. Wood recommends users find an alternative, because SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam will not be re-listed in the directory or receive any future updates.</p>\n<p>The incident is another reminder for users to be on alert when WordPress.org plugins change hands, as the buyers do not always disclose their actual intentions for the plugin.

In a surprising move, Matt Mullenweg announced that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress would also be parting ways with React</a> and planned to remove it from the upcoming Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s decision to drop React from consideration for WordPress was likely an influential factor in Facebook&#8217;s eventual about-face on the topic of re-licensing the project. Facebook&#8217;s announcement on Friday acknowledges that the company failed to convince the open source community of the benefits of its BSD + Patents license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re relicensing these projects because React is the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web, and we don&#8217;t want to hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons. </p>\n<p>This decision comes after several weeks of disappointment and uncertainty for our community. Although we still believe our BSD + Patents license provides some benefits to users of our projects, we acknowledge that we failed to decisively convince this community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The React 16 release, slated for this week, will ship with the updated MIT license. Facebook declined to respond to our request for further comment and said their post is the only public statement they will be providing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear whether WordPress will continue on with React, picking up where the team left off on Gutenberg, or  shift to another library. Core contributors had originally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin/status/911356481936740352\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decided on React</a> while attending WordPress&#8217; community summit in Paris last June, although this decision had not yet been made public when the greater open source community started petitioning Facebook to re-license React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m just so tired of this drama,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said. &#8220;We spent days and days thinking about the best framework for WP, and this change will just add more thinking, complexity, and uncertainty to our decision. I’m just tired of all this&#8230;we all have to rethink everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, who had previously penned a several-thousand word unpublished announcement about how WordPress would be adopting React, did not confirm whether WordPress is still examining other libraries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our decision to move away from React, based on their previous stance, has sparked a lot of interesting discussions in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/facebook-dropping-patent-clause/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> published to his blog this weekend. &#8220;Particularly with Gutenberg there may be an approach that allows developers to write Gutenberg blocks (Gutenblocks) in the library of their choice including Preact, Polymer, or Vue, and now React could be an officially-supported option as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The regularly scheduled core JavaScript meeting is set for Tuesday, September 26 at 15:00 GMT and contributors plan to discuss the role a JS framework will play in current and future core focuses. The time has been changed to be two hours later than originally planned in an effort to accommodate more contributors across various timezones.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:53:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"Matt: Facebook Dropping Patent Clause\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47574\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/facebook-dropping-patent-clause/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1326:\"<p>I am surprised and excited to see the news that Facebook is going to drop the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\">patent clause that I wrote about last week</a>.

I watched a presentation where the presenter had slides with 20+ different recommended tools on them, and not a single mention of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an eCommerce conference, WooCommerce is 41% of all eCommerce stores, and not a single person said the word WooCommerce. All I heard about was Shopify and Amazon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.similartech.com/\">SimilarTech</a>, WooCommerce is leading in the top 100K sites, top 1M sites, and the entire web while Shopify is leading in the top 10K sites. While Shopify has a lot less market share, it&#8217;s used on substantially higher trafficked sites.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared the perspective of a friend who uses Shopify to sell clothing and will gross more than $1M in revenue this year. According to his friend, Shopify is easy to use, from setting up a theme, to the plugin/app ecosystem to add functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When my friend said Shopify is easy to use, this is a whole different category of great user experience,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;This is building a site from scratch for a completely non-technical user, and them loving the end result and the experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger raised an interesting point in that, Wix, Shopify, and SquareSpace are closed, SaaS offerings where they can control the user experience from end-to-end. This is impossible to do with WordPress because there are too many moving parts and core can not control how plugins and themes take part in that experience.</p>\n<p>While WordPress core can&#8217;t necessarily solve the problem, it hasn&#8217;t stopped webhosts from trying. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers\">GoDaddy</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/blog/bluehost-news/welcome-to-the-new-bluehost-8973/\">Bluehost</a>, and others have created onboarding solutions that try to control the end-to-end user experience.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared a sentiment that many in the WordPress community have advocated in recent years. &#8220;If we’re honest, the strength of WordPress is not that it’s easy to use for non-technical people. It’s an open-source platform that is easy for developers to extend and customize for clients.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattreport.com/wordpress-is-not-easy/\">WordPress is Not Easy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mor10.com/wordpress-easy-thats-ok/\">WordPress is not easy – and that’s OK</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://neliosoftware.com/blog/is-wordpress-as-easy-as-we-think/\">Is WordPress As Easy As We Think?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was a time, somewhere between WordPress 2.3 and WordPress 3.5, where one of the main reasons people used WordPress was because it was easy. Between then and now, what caused WordPress to lose its ease-of-use factor?</p>\n<p>SquareSpace, Wix, and Shopify didn&#8217;t exist in the early days of WordPress, they were late to market. This gave them the advantage of implementing all the lessons learned through WordPress&#8217; lifespan and since it&#8217;s a closed system, they can iterate rapidly.</p>\n<p>The biggest reality check that Bolinger shares is that there are a lot of people WordPress simply doesn&#8217;t cater too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a large contingent of people who just want to get stuff done, they don’t want to fuss with the tech&#8221;, He said. &#8220;They don’t care about open source or owning their data. They don’t want to install a theme and setup their widgets, or search thousands of results to find the best SEO plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They don’t want to set up &#8216;managed hosting&#8217;, an SSL certificate, or a payment gateway. They just want to sell their products and make money as fast and easily as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I encourage you to <a href=\"http://scottbolinger.com/perspective-on-wordpress/\">read the full post</a> as it provides a perspective of WordPress not often shared within the WordPress bubble. <a href=\"http://scottbolinger.com/perspective-on-wordpress/\"></a>How does WordPress become a platform that delivers the kind of experience from end-to-end that Bolinger&#8217;s friend describes?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 23 Sep 2017 00:43:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"WPTavern: WordPress Explores a JavaScript Framework-Agnostic Approach to Building Gutenberg Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74900\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-explores-a-javascript-framework-agnostic-approach-to-building-gutenberg-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9072:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/blocks.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: found_drama <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/28555778@N00/30725752376\">E.&#8217;s pirate town</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>The discussion regarding WordPress&#8217; JavaScript framework selection continues in the #core-js Slack channel ahead of next week&#8217;s meeting. One of the more recent topics is the possibility of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">framework-agnostic block rendering</a> for Gutenberg, which would allow developers to extend the new editor using any JS library they prefer. This means that Gutenberg blocks, which are colloquially referred to as &#8220;Gutenblocks,&#8221; could be built with Vue, React, Preact, Angular, or whatever the developer feels comfortable using.</p>\n<p>Proponents of this idea contend that pursuing a more flexible approach makes WordPress&#8217; core JS framework decision <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463#issuecomment-330637007\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">less critical</a>. While answering questions on the #core-js channel, Gary Pendergast explained how Gutenberg could be built to maintain the separation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really not joking when I say that this decision doesn&#8217;t matter, even for people contributing to Gutenberg,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;In <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#2463</a>, the library is treated entirely as a utility library, much like we use lodash, for example. It performs a handful of tasks, and it can be relatively easily pulled out and replaced with something entirely different, with no disruption to the rest of the codebase. For people contributing to Gutenberg, they&#8217;re contributing in the Gutenberg coding style, not the style of whatever library we happen to import.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked about a timeline for when the decision will be made and what factors are being considered, Pendergast replied that there is no timeline and that those interested in participating should blog about their experiences and write examples of things they can build with the JS frameworks they are familiar with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is neither roadmap, nor timeline, nor does there need to be,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;As Matt mentioned, it&#8217;s really just a technical decision &#8211; the important decision for the wider community was choosing &#8216;not React.&#8217; Unfortunately, this decision has been blown way out of proportion, and heavily conflated with &#8216;what JS library will I be able to build my plugins with?&#8217; and sometimes &#8216;what JS library&#8217;s practices will Gutenberg blocks resemble?,&#8217; neither of which are related. Tweets and posts that treat it like a horse race are not helpful in this way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast said whatever library is selected will &#8220;continue to be wrapped by the WordPress element, the underlying library won&#8217;t be exposed.&#8221; The Gutenberg team is working to remove all library dependencies from its components so that plugin developers can use any library they choose.</p>\n<p>However, other community members are not so eager to relegate the JS library selected for core to a simple technical decision or utility library.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most developers understand that their plugins are not bound by the framework chosen for core/Gutenberg,&#8221; Kevin Hoffman said. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t diminish the significance of the decision. If we want to encourage more contributors, we&#8217;d be well served to choose a framework in which a significant majority feel capable and confident. If this majority is out there developing plugins with one framework and has to learn another in order to contribute to core, then we&#8217;re limiting the number of potential contributors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Peter Booker contends that no matter how elegant Gutenberg&#8217;s separation is, having a decent understanding of the library chosen for core affects a developers&#8217; ability to deeply troubleshoot certain issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not think we should be so dismissive of the choice as a minor technical decision,&#8221; Booker said. &#8220;Understanding how PHP, JavaScript, and Backbone (among other things) work is essential to be able to properly debug problems with WordPress. The JS framework chosen for Gutenberg is going to impact a great many people, even if we are not core contributors. It will be essential knowledge to be able to fully troubleshoot issues. This is a decision which will impact far more people than just the Gutenberg team.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What are the implications of providing a flexible, framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks?</h3>\n<p>Jason Bahl asked if anyone has tried mixing React, Preact, Vue, and Angular in a single app to see if it is &#8220;a recipe for a performance nightmare.&#8221; He posed an example scenario wherein Gravity Forms builds Vue-based Gutenblocks, Yoast has React-based blocks, WooCommerce builds blocks with Preact, and another plugin uses Ember.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It sounds kind of nice to be flexible and allow folks to use whatever but also like it could lead to a lot of division on best practices, and potentially performance issues,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see tutorials pop up for how to build Gutenblocks in Vue, React, Preact, Ember, Vanilla JS, etc., which would be cool to see, but also confusing and potentially cause further divide in the community and accepted best practices. Flexibility is nice to a degree, but a strong opinion at some level is also good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Carl Hancock, co-founder of Gravity Forms, contends that offering a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks will have little influence on developers who are extending the project. The decision cannot be made less critical by offering more flexibility, because developers will inevitably adopt whatever WordPress core uses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;Which means however complex that core framework ends up being will have a direct impact on the barrier to entry for plugin and theme developers. That barrier to entry has been historically low to date and a direct contributor to the growth of WordPress as a self-hosted CMS. Dramatically raising that barrier to entry isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For example, Gravity Forms will use Preact, Vue, whatever, because we have the manpower and skillset to do so when we can finally decide to do so once core makes it’s decision.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217; Opportunity to Advance the Web</h3>\n<p>WordPress currently powers 28% of all websites, according to <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">W3 Techs</a>, and whatever framework it chooses will make a major impact on which library many developers decide to learn in order to extend the software and advance their careers.</p>\n<p>Matías Ventura, one of the technical leads on the Gutenberg project, encouraged participants in the discussion to look at the bigger picture and embrace the opportunity to work together and collaborate on a solution for WordPress that will advance the web. The team&#8217;s efforts to collaborate with representatives from competing frameworks stands apart in an ecosystem that is generally fragmented and fractious.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m excited about the opportunity we have to advance web development in terms of JavaScript UI representation, in a similar way to how WordPress was a driving force for web standards during the past decade,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;That’s also where I see us having a responsibility as a project, as people will continue to learn web development through WP. Many people have been introduced to PHP through WordPress, originally just interacting with WP functions and APIs, eventually diving a bit more deeply into the language as needed. I do see our core remaining close to JS the language, as that gives the most meaningful tool to learn, spanning across all frameworks and libraries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura assured participants in the ongoing discussion that the Gutenberg team is listening and working towards a solution that will push the web forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are absolutely aware that how we build and what we offer through Gutenberg is going to affect the dev community and we are not taking this lightly—quite the opposite,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;I’ve been talking with Evan (Vue) and Jason (Preact) because rather than having a &#8216;choose your framework&#8217; contest, this seems an opportunity to collaborate and push the web forwards.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 22:26:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"WPTavern: DonateWC Reaches Fundraising Goal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75001\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wptavern.com/donatewc-reaches-fundraising-goal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1702:\"<p><a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/donatewc-aims-to-provide-travel-sponsorships-to-attend-large-wordcamps\">an initiative</a> focused on providing less fortunate people an opportunity to attend large WordCamps has <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/news/surprise-our-goal-is-fully-funded/\">reached its fundraising goal</a> of 1,000€.

The event was designed for people who use WordPress to manage publications and also to encourage collaboration among project maintainers who build open source tools for publishers.</p>\n<p>In addition to hands-on technical workshops, the <a href=\"https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/schedule/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> included a variety of publishing-related topics, such as monetization, content distribution, newsletter tools, and print and digital workflows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The schedule prompted a great deal of learning and discussion that extended well beyond the content typically found at a regional WordCamp,&#8221; attendee Maura Teal <a href=\"https://mlteal.com/2017/08/wordcamp-publishers-denver/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;One of the best aspects of this conference was chatting with other developers and leaders involved in media on the web. There were multiple sessions and hallway discussions that brought intriguing solutions to the table. My primary takeaway was that there certainly needs to be more WordCamps of this kind &#8211; that is, focused on a niche but still rooted in community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The unique format of the event offered more small group opportunities than a traditional WordCamp does for learning, asking questions, and collaborating around tools and strategies that directly relate to publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp for Publishers was not your average or typical WordCamp,&#8221; attendee Dwayne McDaniel <a href=\"https://www.mcdwayne.com/2017/08/21/wordcamp-for-publishers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;It felt a lot more like WPCampus insofar as the general mood and feeling I got from the participants. Getting to see folks from competing media companies openly discussing how to solve their common challenges, I learned a whole lot and I am grateful to have had the chance to learn about the publishing space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Videos for all of the sessions held in the auditorium are now available in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4P7UHKK-kC1CGF3LDtfPDwtLEzDKiP9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube playlist</a>.

WordPress 4.8 added the new audio, image, and video widgets from this feature plugin. The gallery widget is targeted for merge into the upcoming WordPress 4.9 release.</p>\n<p>In testing the new feature I found it to be a simple, straightforward implementation of a gallery widget that could easily replace many plugins that are currently filling this need for users. The option to edit or replace a gallery is immediately available and users can easily rearrange or randomize the images included.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/core-gallery-widget.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>On the frontend the gallery displays neatly in a thumbnail grid. I was able to change the number of columns while editing the gallery, but the preview in the admin did not match the the way the gallery looks on the frontend. The number of columns is correct on the frontend but not in the admin preview. This might cause some confusion for users if it isn&#8217;t fixed before landing in core. Contributors to the plugin are looking at this <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/issues/190#issuecomment-331011895\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-20-at-3.16.22-PM-e1505938641908.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Overall, the implementation is user-friendly and similar to adding galleries in posts and pages. However, the widget could still use some testing, especially with different plugins installed. For example, with Jetpack enabled, users can choose between a thumbnail and a slideshow gallery, but the slideshow option doesn&#8217;t seem to work correctly in the widget. WordPress.org has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/gallery+widget/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">several hundred plugins</a> that implement some sort of gallery widget and these plugin authors will want to test the new core widget.</p>\n<p>Theme authors will also need to test how the core gallery widget interacts with their themes. After testing the gallery widget with several popular WordPress.org themes, I found that many display the thumbnails with unsightly outlines and unpredictable spacing between images.</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter, who authored the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dev note post</a> when the previous media widgets were introduced in 4.8, said that the paragraph regarding default theme updates is still applicable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Themes that add custom styles to the MediaElement.js player (namely Twenty Thirteen and Twenty Fourteen) were updated from just styling it within syndicated content, to also include instances within widgets. Most themes don’t restrict styles for captioned images or media players to just post content, that is, limit CSS selectors to classes output by post_class(). If your theme does, make sure to either remove that constraint or include a .widget selector.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ruter said another dev note will be coming with common theme changes that are required to add the right styling for galleries. Users and theme/plugin developers can test the gallery widget right now on 4.8.2 or 4.9-alpha using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Once the widget is added to WordPress, it will be deactivated in the feature plugin for future releases. Contributors plan to merge the new widget into core next week, provided testing goes well.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 00:35:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 288 – No React.js Framework for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=74933&preview=true&preview_id=74933\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-288-no-react-js-framework-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3046:\"<p>While I was supposed to be on vacation last week, I instead had surgery for a broken ankle.

I had become a part of something bigger than myself.\" /><p>The first time I ever made a WordPress site, I got 180,000 views in 2 days, 253 comments, and (give or take) 7 death threats.</p>\n<p>It was 2014 and I was working on an MBA at Florida State University during the peak of the Jameis Winston controversy, where a football quarterback was accused of rape and protected from prosecution by the university and local police. I had used WordPress before, but not a lot. But, in true democratizing publishing, giving a voice to the voiceless fashion, when I had something I wanted to say, I knew just the thing to get it out there with minimal know-how: a free, single page WordPress.com site.</p>\n<p>I had just returned to Florida from a summer in New York City. To my amazement, I got the life-changing opportunity, paid for by the university’s College of Social Sciences paid, to go up there for a summer of exploration in the social entrepreneurship and technology circles after pitching Florida State on a concept for financial education.</p>\n<h3>Beginning the Journey</h3>\n<p>I had become interested in financial education around the age of 16, when my family became homeless for a month. My mom hadn’t been able to make the rent, so we got kicked out, and then couldn’t find an apartment easily due to my mom’s lack of credit. Later, I started working at a major commercial bank and met hundreds, if not thousands, of people in similar situations (and saw the ways in which major commercial banks don’t help these people, but that’s a different conversation).</p>\n<p>Imagine having been homeless at 16. Then, 6 years later, you’re attending graduate school, funded by the university, and that same university also paid for you to live in the country’s most expensive place for 3 months so that you could learn about executing your ideas on how to make a positive difference through technology entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>You would probably be overcome with gratefulness. But you would also likely be extremely protective of the people making such a thing possible.</p>\n<p>Now imagine, that while Florida State University’s programs making such an impact on you, a football player’s actions are driving the narrative of this place you want to be proud of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine me, telling the story I just told you, and watching people connect the dots between what institution was making all of this possible for me, and what they had heard of it. “Oh, my God, with the quarterback that raped that girl?” they would say.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would link you to the page I created, but quite honestly, it wasn’t a lot more than a profanity-laden rant (of admittedly epic proportions). But, it got a reaction: she needs to shut the f**k up. She’s completely right. She’s an “attention-seeking whore!”. She’s the story we should be focusing on. She’s just upset her Kickstarter campaign failed.</p>\n<p>There it was: WordPress had amplified my voice, and everyone else’s, too.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress Business</h3>\n<p>Today, I’m the lesser-known half of Caldera Labs, makers of Caldera Forms, a top drag-and-drop form building plugin for WordPress. A few weeks ago, we got a one-star review on WordPress.org that called me out by name: “their team is useless, especially Christie Chirinos.” I received caring notes from several seasoned WordPress product developers, reassuring me that these things happen and I ought to not take it personally. “It’s not the first time someone’s been mean to me on the internet, and it probably won’t be the last,” I wrote in a Slack DM to my incredible business partner, the part of Caldera Labs you probably know, Josh Pollock. Josh laughed.</p>\n<p>My road from single-page rants on WordPress.com to WordPress product leadership was actually pretty straightforward, although certainly wrapped in incredible fortune. I kept up that blog for a few months at the request of some of those 253 people (and the dismay of some others). Eventually it was forgotten for my financial education project’s website, which went from Wix to self-hosted WordPress.</p>\n<p>Some months of working on that site made me acutely aware that if I wanted to execute more of my ideas, I should learn more code. I started learning JavaScript and PHP. I met Josh somewhere around that time. He liked my WordPress.com story, and encouraged me to keep learning, while picking my brain on what my almost-finished MBA thought about Caldera Forms.</p>\n<p>A professor asked me if I would work on his academic WordPress website for a fee. I was a broke graduate student, so I said yes. Suddenly I had clients. When I graduated, Josh approached me with a proposal to join him in business. I said yes, but my only condition is that I’m moving back to New York City. Josh said, remote work is the norm.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2118\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen_shot_2017-09-19_at_8.26.20_pm-1024x374.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of Caldera website\" width=\"960\" height=\"351\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the quote-unquote “formal business education,” I was flabbergasted when the full weight of what a WordPress product business entailed hit me. I didn’t understand the community. I didn’t understand the niche’s culture. Much of what I learned were business norms, were completely non-existent in WordPress. I communicated all of this to Josh.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I have no idea what I’m doing.”</p>\n<p>“Of course you don’t, you’ve never done this before.”</p>\n<p>He introduced me to the extensive library of talks on WordPress TV on imposter syndrome.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Diving Into WordCamp</h3>\n<p>For me, it clicked at the inaugural WordCamp US. I showed up to the event looking like a deer caught in the headlights and was welcomed with open arms. I got to put faces to all of the names I had learned in the last half-year, and surprise: they were nice. They were welcoming. They were understanding.</p>\n<p>I scoffed at the idea that I would have anything to contribute on Contributor Day, and then found out that the polyglots team could totally use an immigrant that speaks 4 languages. More importantly, I became completely inspired by the mission of WordPress. I realized that, by total accident (or perhaps completely on purpose), I had become a part of something bigger than myself. I had to stick with it, no matter how hard it was.</p>\n<p>In the year after that, I also began to find a small niche for myself. I became “the girl with the MBA,” smart, young, and clearly lucky. “There’s not a lot of people in the space with your background,” said the host interviewing me on a WordPress podcast. Meanwhile, I’m thinking to myself, “oh my god. I don’t even understand why you invited me. I’m very grateful, but I also really don’t know that much about business. Didn’t you notice? Didn’t anyone tell you?”</p>\n<p>Move forward a year, and results started rolling in. I spoke at 4 WordCamps and many other shows. Josh published his 2016 Year In Review, where he outlined the explosive growth that Caldera Forms experienced at the end of the year and acknowledged the benefit of having partnered with me. He doesn’t know this, but I cried when I read that (now he knows).</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was surreal: the unlikely thing that we set out to do was working.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This year, 2017, has consisted of taking on the next step in that process: teaching myself how to turn all of those thoughts on their heads. I have had to unlearn “why me?” and internalize “why not me?”, and most importantly, practice differentiating the story that I tell myself about myself versus the evidence-based reality.</p>\n<h3>Self Discovery</h3>\n<p>A crucial part of this stage has been learning that what I do does not define who I am. That’s a tired joke where I live. The joke goes that you can go to any bar, and participate in the same script: what’s your name? What do you do? “I’m Christie, and I’m a partner and the business manager at a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” is a story, and it immediately sparks self-doubt. That isn’t an answer that describes an evidence-based reality, it is an answer that describes a story, and stories by definition require effort to be believed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Who I am, I am learning, is the collection of my experiences, which then drive my priorities in how I do what I do, which is business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In that podcast interview, I wasn’t told “there aren’t many business managers in the space.” I was told that there weren’t a lot of people with my background in the space. It’s the collection of my stories &#8211; of immigration, difficult childhoods, arguments in business school classrooms and accidentally viral WordPress websites, that perfectly positioned me to do what I’m doing right now.</p>\n<p>The main reason I wanted to write for HeroPress when Topher offered was to take these thoughts out of my story. The more I grow into this role, the more I’m learning that this is especially common with people like me.</p>\n<p>Research is being conducted more and more every day seeking to discover why we don’t become entrepreneurs who fearlessly pursue happiness and high-risk, high-reward situations (the common trope being that privilege is being told to strive to be anything one wants to be, while others are told to strive for an escape from instability).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of it boils down to the idea that many minorities, women, immigrants, people from low-income households &#8211; take your pick &#8211; have convinced themselves of a story that does not, in fact, reflect the reality of their possibilities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s a shame, because there’s almost as much research that demonstrates that businesses with diverse leadership teams outperform homogeneous teams almost every single time.</p>\n<p>Let’s start talking about this, even if this isn’t something that directly relates to you. Because, if that is the case, chances are that this is a topic that relates to someone you know. Diversity of thought is an important part of our WordPress community narrative. If you are not the person who must assess replacing a story with an evidence-based reality, you may be someone who is positioned to engage in powerful actions to promote diversity of thought, like encouraging someone else to challenge the stories they tell themselves and the stories they tell others about themselves. “I’m Christie, and I lead all of the business development and marketing for a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” sounds a lot better.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=What%20I%20Do%20Does%20Not%20Define%20Who%20I%20Am&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F&title=What+I+Do+Does+Not+Define+Who+I+Am\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/092017-150x150.jpg&description=What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/\" title=\"What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/\">What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 12:00:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"Christie Chirinos\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.2 Patches Eight Security Vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-2-patches-eight-security-vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:840:\"<p>WordPress 4.8.2 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\">is available for download</a> and users are encouraged to update as soon as possible.

Version 3.2 is on track to make the process of updating stores a smoother experience with a long-awaited new feature that displays version compatibility checks to users prior to updating their extensions.</p>\n<p>Many WooCommerce store owners experienced considerable difficulties in updating to version 3.0 due to incompatibilities with extensions that were not fully compatible. The widespread problems with updating caused a direct hit to the plugin&#8217;s reputation, even though the main issue was with third-party extensions not being ready to go for 3.0. WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s new pre-update extension version checks will help users to be more informed about the status of extension compatibility before updating.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce plugin developers can now add two new headers to their extensions to specify a minimum required version and a &#8220;tested up to&#8221; version.<br />\n<code><br />\n/*<br />\n * Plugin Name: WooCommerce Barter Gateway<br />\n * Plugin URI: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-barter/<br />\n * Description: Take payments by bartering crops and livestock.<br />\n * Author: WooCommerce<br />\n * Author URI: https://woocommerce.com/<br />\n * Version: 3.0.7<br />\n * Text Domain: woocommerce-gateway-barter<br />\n * Domain Path: /languages<br />\n * WC requires at least: 3.0.0<br />\n * WC tested up to: 3.2.0<br />\n */</code></p>\n<p>Plugin authors are recommended to update these headers after each major and minor WooCommerce release. (Patch releases do not require headers to be updated.)</p>\n<p>The core WooCommerce plugin will check through the extension headers and display a warning to users when updates are available, detailing which plugins have or haven&#8217;t been tested with the latest major version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pre-update-extension-version-checks.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce developer Claudiu Lodromanean cited several important benefits for extension developers in a <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> announcing the new feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will have to field fewer complaints from users that the new WooCommerce version broke your plugin. They will have clear warnings about the dangers of upgrading when the plugin is incompatible. This should reduce your support load when new versions of WooCommerce are released.</li>\n<li>You will not have to rush updates to your plugin. If a user upgrades WooCommerce and your plugin breaks you are under a lot of pressure to release an update fast. If the user waits until a compatible version of the plugin is released before updating WooCommerce you do not have this problem.</li>\n<li>Users will trust your plugin more. By adding the header you are letting the user know that the plugin has been tested, works with their version of WooCommerce, and is actively maintained to be compatible with WooCommerce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pre-update version checks for extensions is an exciting improvement for store owners and the greater WooCommerce developer community. Updates will be much easier when users can see at a glance which of their extensions are ready to go. Developers are also <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/#comment-3635\" target=\"_blank\">interested in seeing this feature applied for themes</a> and the WooCommerce team confirmed they will look into the possibility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/important-update-woocommerce-3-2-will-now-be-released-october-11th/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s release date</a> has been pushed back one week to October 11 to give store owners and extension developers enough time to test.

As Vue is once again among the leading contenders, I reached out to Vue.js creator Evan You to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress adopting the framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, I had a conversation with the WordPress team mostly answering questions they had about Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;The discussion happened before Matt&#8217;s announcement of moving away from React. It was mostly intended for filling the team in with the state of Vue and there was no particular conclusion made from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I got the feeling that the team had already decided to go with React and simply wanted to explore other options before they make the final call. I was a bit surprised by Matt&#8217;s post, but also understand the concerns behind that decision. I think React is a technically sound choice, and the whole patent issue is unfortunate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vue is back in the mix alongside Preact.js and other libraries WordPress core contributors are considering adopting. You has been active in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/31/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-30th/#comment-32642\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> on the WordPress core development blog during the previous discussion, as well as more recently in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733#issuecomment-330124938\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> in Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repo, clarifying misconceptions about the financial stability of the project.</p>\n<p>You has been careful to disclose his bias when participating in conversations about which framework WordPress should adopt. During my interview with him, he offered the community three reasons why he sees Vue as a good fit for the project:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that WP has decided to pick a different framework, as the creator of Vue, I surely hope that the WordPress team can adopt Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Below is why I believe Vue would be a good fit for the choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;As an independent open source project (not born from within a major corporate), Vue provides a good alignment in terms of OSS values with the WordPress project. It&#8217;s fully MIT licensed, and its development is sustained by open financial contribution channels (via Patreon and OpenCollective). This means WordPress can easily ensure Vue&#8217;s sustainability by becoming a major sponsor.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Vue is one of the most approachable frameworks out there, with an established and active community, and ever-growing amount of learning resources. Adopting Vue would provide a low entry barrier and smooth learning curve for devs just getting into WordPress development. This also aligns with what made WordPress successful.</li>\n<li>&#8220;As an incrementally adoptable framework, Vue&#8217;s flexibility means it can be adapted in different use cases ranging from embedded widgets, plugin development to full single-page applications. It can be used without any compilation step in simple use cases, while being mature and powerful enough for more complex use cases such as Calypso and Gutenberg. It offers the complete stack from vdom + ability to use raw render functions, server-side rendering, routing, state management, build tooling, browser devtool extensions, to editor tooling support.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evan You and six others from the Vue.js core team will be participating in an <a href=\"https://hashnode.com/ama/with-vuejs-team-cj7itlrki03ae62wuv2r2005s\" target=\"_blank\">AMA on Hashnode at 12PM on September 20</a>, inviting general questions about the project, how to use it and contribute, and general programming advice. The questions are already rolling in and their answers should provide more information about the future of Vue and its place in the wider JavaScript ecosystem.</p>\n<p>WP Tavern has also reached out to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_developit\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Miller</a>, creator of Preact.js to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress selecting Preact and what it would mean for both projects. The React-alternative is another strong contender among JS libraries WordPress is looking at for use in core.</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has been working to ensure that WordPress developers will be able to create &#8220;Gutenblocks&#8221; using any JS library they prefer with different explorations of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" target=\"_blank\">framework-agnostic block rendering</a>. Ultimately, this would make creating plugins and themes less dependent on the library that is chosen for use in core. Other community members involved in the discussion, however, are keen to emphasize that the framework selected will have an impact on the greater WordPress product ecosystem, far beyond its use in Gutenberg, and are not eager to down play it as a simple technical decision. We&#8217;ll have a more detailed look on that in a separate post.</p>\n<p>In addition to the discussions on independent blogs, the Gutenberg GitHub issues queue and the #core-js channel on WordPress Slack are both hosting active conversations on the upcoming decision.

HeroPress started out to be a voice for people on the fringe of WordPress, and being outside the ability to go to WordCamp practically defines the fringe.</p>\n<p>I never could figure out the logistics of how to make it work. How is money handled? International law? So the idea languished.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the world, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/getting-a-life/\">Ines van Essen</a> had the same idea. She&#8217;s far more clever than I though, and she&#8217;s making it happen. She&#8217;s starting a new organization called DonateWC, specifically to help people get to WordCamp.  Not just local WordCamps, but the large ones like WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US. Trips that can cost multiple months, or even a years salary.</p>\n<p>I am so so so excited that this is happening, Ines is my hero.</p>\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\n<p>To get things really rolling Ines needs some funds.  I mentioned logistics earlier; if this isn&#8217;t handled properly a tax agent somewhere is going to come investigating. A non-profit org needs to be created, a logo needs to be created, a site needs to be built, a board needs to be formed, etc. Getting started costs money.</p>\n<p>So <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/startup-cost-for-donatewc\">there&#8217;s a GoFundMe page for DonateWC</a>. All things considered she&#8217;s not looking for very much money right now, we can DO THIS.</p>\n<p>If we can make this thing work it&#8217;s going to really change lives. Please help out if you can, and keep an eye on the project. The first person to get sent to WordCamp is going to make history.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=DonateWC%3A%20Getting%20People%20to%20WordCamp&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F&title=DonateWC%3A+Getting+People+to+WordCamp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23950564_1505660479.8301-150x150.png&description=DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/\" title=\"DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/\">DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 20:42:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: Vue Project Launches Community Campaign on OpenCollective\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74756\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/vue-project-launches-community-campaign-on-opencollective\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4392:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-15-at-2.13.34-PM-e1505502876371.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With the recent news that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress is abandoning React</a> due to its BSD + Patents license, core contributors are now revisiting the discussion of the merits of other frameworks. Gutenberg development is currently on hold until a new library is chosen to replace React, and selection is likely to be imminent to prevent further delay.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Vue</a> is once again a strong contender with a recent surge in enthusiastic support in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733\" target=\"_blank\">discussions on GitHub</a>, Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624213760974165/\" target=\"_blank\">social</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624383604290514/\" target=\"_blank\">media</a> posts. One of the chief concerns WordPress core contributors had regarding Vue in previous discussions was the longevity of the project and its dependence on creator <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Evan You</a>, who has historically done most of the development.</p>\n<p>The Vue project has recently been taking steps to mitigate this drawback. Earlier this week You announced that <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-is-now-on-opencollective-1ef89ca1334b\" target=\"_blank\">Vue is now accepting financial support on OpenCollective</a>, a platform for funding open source projects in a transparent way. You already has a successful <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/evanyou\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon campaign</a> where contributors are paying $8,815 per month to support his work on Vue, but the new <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/vuejs\" target=\"_blank\">OpenCollective account</a> will support the work of core contributors and community events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I started the Patreon campaign, the primary goal was providing myself with enough income so that I can work on Vue full-time,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Today, as the Vue community grows, there are more and more contributions from the community, and OpenCollective’s transparent expense model could help us scale the financial contributions beyond a single developer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just four days after launching, Vue already has an estimated annual budget of $9,895 on its OpenCollective account. You is still independently accepting contributions on Patreon to fund his full-time work on the project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Preact</a>, the other leading contender WordPress core contributors are considering, has had an <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/preact\" target=\"_blank\">account on OpenCollective</a> since late 2016. Backers and sponsors have contributed to a $16,091 estimated annual budget for the project.</p>\n<p>Both Vue and Preact have growing networks of financial supporters and are not heavily influenced by a single corporation&#8217;s interests. WordPress core contributors continue to discuss the merits and drawbacks of the two frameworks on various places around the web, but the discussion is somewhat scattered and it&#8217;s difficult for participants to know where their feedback will receive consideration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main options are actually all pretty good, and we&#8217;d probably be fine going with any of them, which is makes it a tough decision — objectively and technically there isn&#8217;t one clear without-a-doubt winner,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg said today in WordPress&#8217; #core-js Slack channel.</p>\n<p>An updated post detailing the frameworks and technical considerations that contributors are now examining has yet to be published to the make/wordpress.org development blog. Having communication throughout the process of selecting the framework, instead of announcing it after the decision, would go a long way towards keeping the community informed and involved. We&#8217;ll be following the public discussion as it develops.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 19:54:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: WordPress Abandons React due to Patents Clause, Gutenberg to be Rewritten with a Different Library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74834\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7411:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wrinkled-paper.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/6XVYR9HYNT\">	Lalesh Aldarwish</a>\n<p>This evening Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> on his blog that WordPress has decided to move away from React due to its BSD + Patents clause licensing. Gutenberg engineers will be rewriting the new editor to use another JavaScript framework and Automattic plans to rewrite Calypso as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#8217;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#8217;t be published, and instead I&#8217;m here to say that the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg clarified that Automattic has been happy with React and that the company&#8217;s general counsel <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367\" target=\"_blank\">didn&#8217;t think they would ever run into the patent issue</a>. He also commended Facebook on being &#8220;one of the better open source contributors out there&#8221; and for making their intentions clear. Ultimately, Mullenweg decided that he wasn&#8217;t comfortable with the larger WordPress community inheriting the patents clause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses, many open source project leaders and developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies\" target=\"_blank\">petitioned Facebook to consider re-licensing React</a>, as many React-based projects are now having to be rewritten. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook decided it wasn&#8217;t budging on the patents clause</a> and opted to continue protecting its own interests, fully recognizing that it may lose some React community members.</p>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has been outspoken about how Automattic was betting on React. Many in the community considered WordPress adopting React to be a foregone conclusion, given that both Calypso and Jetpack&#8217;s new admin interface were built on it, as well as WordPress&#8217; new Gutenberg editor. In making the costly decision to rewrite Gutenberg and Automattic&#8217;s products in another library, Mullenweg has demonstrated he is willing to lead the WordPress project in a direction where the community can feel confident about continuing to use and extend the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#8217;re always listening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg could certainly use the extra time and may gain a new crop of contributors, given that the learning curve for the new library isn&#8217;t likely to be as steep as learning React.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, WordPress core contributors had <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-debate-heats-up-contributors-narrow-discussion-to-react-vs-vue\" target=\"_blank\">narrowed their considerations for a new JavaScript framework to React and Vue</a>. It appears that <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Vue</a> is still a strong contender. After a commenter on Mullenweg&#8217;s post suggested switching to Vue, he replied that it has been frequently suggested and that the team has met with Evan You, Vue&#8217;s lead developer.</p>\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed Evan You in June</a>, he said he didn&#8217;t have enough perspective on WordPress core to make an unbiased recommendation but offered feedback on some technical issues being discussed at the time. He also clarified some common misconceptions about Vue, which WordPress&#8217; React proponents had been using as leverage in their arguments against adopting it.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg also confirmed in the comments of his post that <a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Preact</a> is another library under consideration. Preact.js is a lightweight 3kB alternative to React that uses the same API but is MIT-licensed. Some are already speculating about Preact being the front-runner for the replacement, as Gutenberg already has a branch devoted to trying it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There is a Preact “try” Gutenberg branch. But there is no Vue.js “try” Gutenberg branch. <a href=\"https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b\">https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f680.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@carlhancock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/908510738066657281\">September 15, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, Mullenweg&#8217;s comment that the decision &#8220;will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year,&#8221; seems to only be feasible if the team rewrites the project using Preact.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For Gutenberg, not Calypso.

Many are thankful and relieved that Mullenweg made the tough decision to change course and select another library after investing so heavily in React.</p>\n<p>The discussion regarding the new framework continues behind closed doors and is not open to the public, although a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2732\" target=\"_blank\">pull request for using Preact in Gutenberg</a> is open on the project&#8217;s GitHub repo and some community discussion regarding the library selection is happening there.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 05:39:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: On React and WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47558\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3758:\"<p>Big companies like to bury unpleasant news on Fridays: A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/\">Facebook announced</a> they have decided to dig in on their patent clause addition to the React license, even after Apache had said <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303\">it’s no longer allowed for Apache.org projects</a>.

I appreciate that they&#x27;ve made their intentions going forward clear.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Automattic used React as the basis for the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/\">ground-up rewrite of WordPress.com we called Calypso</a>, I believe it&#x27;s one of the larger React-based open source projects. As our general counsel wrote, <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367\">we made the decision that we&#x27;d never run into the patent issue</a>. That is still true today as it was then, and overall, we’ve been really happy with React. More recently, the WordPress community started to use React for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/17/dev-chat-summary-february-15th-4-7-3-week-3/\">Gutenberg</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">the largest core project we&#x27;ve taken on in many years</a>. People&#x27;s experience with React and the size of the React community &#8212;  including Calypso &#8212; was a factor in trying out React for Gutenberg, and that made React the new de facto standard for WordPress and the tens of thousands of plugins written for WordPress.</p>\n<p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#x27;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#x27;t be published, and instead I&#x27;m here to say that <strong>the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library</strong>. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p>\n<p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the <em>long-term consistency</em> with core is worth more than a <em>short-term hit</em> to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p>\n<p>I think Facebook’s clause is actually clearer than many other approaches companies could take, and Facebook has been one of the better open source contributors out there. But we have a lot of problems to tackle, and convincing the world that Facebook’s patent clause is fine isn’t ours to take on. It’s their fight. </p>\n<p>The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision. We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#x27;re always listening.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:59:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: First WordCamp Dublin Set for October 14-15\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74595\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/first-wordcamp-dublin-set-for-october-14-15\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4577:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dublin.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.ireland.com/en-us/what-is-available/sightseeing/destinations/republic-of-ireland/dublin/dublin-city/\">Ireland.com</a>\n<p>Following up on the success of WordCamp Belfast last October, the WordPress community in <a href=\"https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Dublin will be hosting its first WordCamp October 14-15</a>. Both camps <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-meetup-groups-in-belfast-and-dublin-are-planning-wordcamps-for-2016-and-2017\" target=\"_blank\">began the early stages of planning last year</a> and the two communities have shared some of the same organizers across their teams to help get these new camps off the ground in Ireland.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will be held at <a href=\"http://business.dcu.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">DCU Business School</a> and ticket sales will be capped at 250. In truly affordable WordCamp tradition, tickets are only €35 and include access to two tracks of speakers on both camp days, catered lunch, and an after party on Saturday night in Dublin City Centre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given it’s our first WordCamp Dublin it’s difficult to select a venue when we’ve no idea about how many people would like to attend,&#8221; co-organizer Colm Troy said. &#8220;But demand so far has been great so if you want a ticket I’d recommend getting one sooner rather than later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the camp&#8217;s five organizers are also part of the Dublin WordPress meetup, which is fairly active with 25-30 people attending regularly. They meet the first Thursday of every month and host a local speaker to teach attendees something new. WordPress developers generally gravitate towards the more technical talks, while WordPress users are more interested in talks about improving and promoting their websites.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will feature one track with advanced WordPress, coding, and development topics and a second track that covers aspects of running a business, growing website traffic, podcasting, and other related topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;​The Dublin WordPress community, based on what I’ve seen and experienced elsewhere (Buenos Aires, Paris, Vienna, UK, Italy), is pretty unusual,&#8221; co-organizer Rodolfo Melogli said. In addition to co-organizing the local WordPress meetup, Melogli also organizes the Dublin E-commerce and WooCommerce Meetups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have complete beginners, who after years of using other CMSs have finally decided to start using WordPress,&#8221; Melogli said. &#8220;We have passionate bloggers, who have been exploiting the SEO and content management features of WordPress since the very beginning. Then, we&#8217;ve got successful themers, popular plugin developers and experienced WordPress freelancers. Making sure everyone is catered for at each WordPress meetup and at the upcoming WordCamp is our biggest challenge and main priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The beautiful thing about the WordPress community, and especially in Dublin, is that you can have a successful theme seller sitting beside a complete beginner. And they both have things to share.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers have just announced the <a href=\"https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/speakers-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">full lineup of speakers</a> for the WordCamp and co-organizer Colm Troy said the team was &#8220;blown away by the quality and quantity of excellent speaking applications&#8221; they received.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s designers have created a new &#8220;blocky&#8221; style wapuu for the occasion to accompany the event&#8217;s modular design theme. They were aiming for a Lego-like wapuu while incorporating the cosmopolitan landmark &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_of_Dublin\" target=\"_blank\">Spire of Dublin</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-dublin-2017.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;​We have a couple of ideas floating around that will definitely add a unique Irish aspect to WordCamp Dublin but it’s too early to let the cat out of the bag on those yet,&#8221; Troy said. &#8220;In terms of what people can expect, Dublin and Ireland in general has a well earned reputation as one of the most welcoming places in the world. In many ways, our welcoming spirit is closely aligned with the ethos of the WordPress community and I think it’s going to be a really special weekend for attendees regardless of whether they’re new to WordPress or WordCamp veterans.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:15:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: GitHub Partners with Facebook to Release Atom-IDE\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74752\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/github-partners-with-facebook-to-release-atom-ide\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3269:\"<p>GitHub <a href=\"http://blog.atom.io/2017/09/12/announcing-atom-ide.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the launch of Atom-IDE this week, a new set of packages that extend its open source JavaScript-powered code editor to include IDE-like functionality.

WordPress developers have created <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/search?q=WordPress\" target=\"_blank\">more than a dozen packages</a> that support actions and filters, WP-CLI commands, documentation, and snippets for third-party plugins.</p>\n<p>Those who have adopted Atom appreciate its extendability, but the most common complaint from the Atom community is that the code editor is noticeably <a href=\"https://discuss.atom.io/t/why-is-atom-so-slow/11376/193\" target=\"_blank\">slower than many others</a>. This has been a frequent <a href=\"https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-painfully-slow/36298\" target=\"_blank\">topic</a> of <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8989606\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> for several years and its creators admit that <a href=\"https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-feels-slow-or-is-consuming-too-much-cpu-or-memory/32662?source_topic_id=36298\" target=\"_blank\">performance isn&#8217;t one of its strongest features</a>. However, sometimes extreme performance issues can be caused by a package that a user has installed.</p>\n<p>Atom partnered with Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https://nuclide.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Nuclide</a> project developers to develop the new <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui\" target=\"_blank\">Atom IDE UI</a> package that uses Atom’s <a href=\"https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient\" target=\"_blank\">atom-languageclient</a> library in displaying features supported by the <a href=\"http://langserver.org/\" target=\"_blank\">language server protocol</a>. Users who want to get started with Atom-IDE will need to install the Atom IDE UI package as well as an IDE language support package (i.e. <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/ide-php\" target=\"_blank\">ide-php</a>).</p>\n<p>Using Atom-IDE currently requires Atom Beta 1.21+. In the future the team plans to add support for more languages, which will most likely happen through outside package contributions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the help of our community, we plan to expand the number of languages that Atom-IDE can support and make it possible for you to run and edit applications, making Atom-IDE a true IDE,&#8221; Damien Guard said. &#8220;We hope to see future language support for the great languages out there including Rust, Go, Python, etc.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:12:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Display Widgets Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Malicious Code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74768\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6033:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/\" target=\"_blank\">Display Widgets</a>, a plugin with more than 200,000 active installs, has been removed from WordPress.org due to its authors inserting malicious code.

According to their independent investigation, the plugin included a backdoor that allowed the plugin author to publish spam content to the sites where Display Widgets is installed. It also prevented logged-in users from being able to see the content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pagely.com/blog/2017/09/malicious-code-display-widgets/\" target=\"_blank\">Pagely banned the Display Widgets plugin</a> from its hosting platform this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For our customer’s safety, we have banned the plugin from our customer sites&#8230;The plugin will remained banned on our network until a time that we see someone has taken responsibility for the plugin and the future of patching its code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets had recently changed hands, as it was acquired from the team that created Formidable Forms.

They do not receive a notice in the WordPress admin about the plugin having been removed from the directory. Since Display Widgets was a fairly popular plugin, there are likely many sites that still have it active and those website owners are probably unaware of the spam content they are publishing.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the plugin team issued a notice that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-2-7-is-safe/\" target=\"_blank\">Display Widgets 2.7 is a clean version</a> that restores the plugin to version 2.0.5 before the malicious code was added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will be leaving this version deploying updates, however at this time we will NOT be allowing for its adoption.

It’s not supported, it’s not worked on, nothing. So if you have it, upgrade. Otherwise, find something else to use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets is now likely to end up in the graveyard of abandoned plugins, but there are many other options for adding conditional widget display to WordPress sites.

One meta trac <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> requests that closed plugins have a public page instead of disappearing completely. In another related <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2860\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a>, plugin team member Mika Epstein has proposed that when plugins are closed or disabled, there should be a dropdown for WordPress.org admins to select a reason why. She suggested the following as available options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Issue</li>\n<li>Author Request</li>\n<li>Guideline Violation</li>\n<li>Licensing/Trademark violations</li>\n<li>Merged into Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue with Display Widgets was fairly public as users posted about their investigations on the WordPress.org support forums and various companies issued warnings about it. However, many plugins are disabled without the public knowing why. Even a short explanation like the proposed examples above would be a major improvement over leaving WordPress.org plugin users in the dark.
